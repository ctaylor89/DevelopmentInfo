	Prompt engineering
You probaly heard this term before. It basically means the process of structuring text for text-based Generative AI models in 
order to make them more efficient and accurate. I spent a night experimenting and made a prompt that is good enough to generate 
code by itself with only a little guidence. 
----------------------------------------
Yes, you can use C# for AI programming. In fact, Microsoft has developed a free, open-source, cross-platform machine learning 
framework called ML.NET specifically for .NET developers 1. With ML.NET, you can develop and integrate custom machine learning 
models into your .NET applications, without needing prior machine learning experience

Using_Prompt_Engineering

Ask ChatGPT the 80/20 for <your topic>
 "80/20" What are the 20% of concepts I need to understand to get 80% of the value from this topic?

Can pass it study notes and ask it to generate questions
 "Study Notes"Turn my notes into 15 paractice questions.

Can break down a log hard explanation
 "Text notes" Explain in simple terms
---
Can optimize a resume for the skill and experience that I am applying to. You can input a resume and a job description 
into chatgpt. Generate a resume for a Software Developer with the following information:"Work History"

Can be a mock interviewer.
 I am preparing for a tech interview. Roleplay as an interviewer at a tech company hiring a frontend engineer, I am an applicant 
 for the position. Ask me a question, wait for my response, evaluate my response, then ask me the next question.
 ChatGPT will respond with suggestions to improve your answers.
---
Can act as a coding assistant by analyzing error msgs, suggesting optimizations or helping with syntax.  

Prompt Engineering is structuring a prompt to get the most specific answer that I am looking for. 
The components of a prompt:
	Context: I'm planning a trip to San Antonio, Texas, and need some recommendations.
	Question: What are the top attractions to visit in San Antonio?
	Details: I prefer to walk and sightsee.

Can summarize information into a markdown table.
 Summarize the above information by putting important information into a markdown table.

Few-shot prompting is a technique used in natural language processing and AI, particularly in models like GPT 
(Generative Pre-trained Transformer). Here's what it involves:

Few-shot learning: This is a machine learning approach where a model is trained on a small amount of data (few shots) to 
perform a specific task. The idea is to generalize from a few examples provided during training to new, unseen examples 
during inference.

Prompting: In the context of GPT and similar models, prompting refers to providing specific instructions or examples to guide the 
model in generating text that meets certain criteria or answers particular questions.

Few-shot prompting: Combines these concepts by training a model on a small number of examples (few shots) provided in the form of 
prompts. These prompts are designed to teach the model how to perform a specific task or answer a specific type of question. The 
model then uses this knowledge to generalize and generate responses to similar tasks or questions it encounters later, even if 
they were not explicitly included in the training data.

For example, if you want a model to summarize news articles, you might provide a few examples of news articles along with their 
summaries during training. The model learns to generalize from these examples and can then summarize new articles it hasn't seen 
before based on that learning.

Few-shot prompting is valuable because it allows models like GPT to adapt quickly to new tasks or domains with minimal additional 
training, making them more flexible and applicable to a wider range of applications.

Vibe_Coding
Key characteristics (from the sources)
It’s an AI?assisted technique where a developer describes a task to a large language model, which generates the code.

The developer does not review or edit the code, but evaluates it by running it and asking the AI to improve it.

It emphasizes natural?language prompting instead of traditional coding.

The term was introduced by Andrej Karpathy in early 2025.

It became widely recognized — even listed as a trending term by Merriam?Webster and named Word of the Year 2025 by Collins Dictionary

How it differs from traditional AI?assisted coding
Traditional AI coding tools (like autocomplete or Copilot suggestions) still assume you’re reading, editing, and understanding the code.

Vibe coding flips that:

Traditional AI Coding			Vibe Coding
You write and review code		You describe what you want and let AI write it
You inspect and edit output		You avoid reviewing code and iterate via prompts
Focus on correctness			Focus on experimentation and flow
AI assists						AI leads, you guide

Sources emphasize that vibe coding is more about flow, iteration, and creativity than about code structure or correctness.

It aligns with the rise of agentic AI systems that can build, debug, and refine applications conversationally
It’s a shift from “writing code” to “guiding an AI to build software.”

Vibe coding is practical for enterprise and regulated environments, but not as a free?form, anything?goes workflow.
It only works when wrapped in strong governance, architecture controls, compliance processes, and human oversight.

Enterprise vibe coding offers speed and flexibility for greenfield projects, but it carries legal, architectural, and operational risks in complex or regulated domains.

Meaning:
Great for prototypes, internal tools, and low?risk apps
Risky for core systems, PHI/PII workflows, or safety?critical software
--
Regulated industries face additional challenges
Regulated sectors (healthcare, finance, defense, energy) require traceability, compliance, and software quality that often clash with vibe coding’s loose, experimental nature.

Key conflicts:
Vibe coding lacks built?in audit trails
AI?generated code may violate compliance rules
Harder to prove correctness, safety, and regulatory alignment
IP ownership and licensing concerns
--
Enterprises must add structure, governance, and guardrails
Enterprise vibe coding tools can accelerate development, but choosing the wrong platform can expose companies to security breaches and compliance violations.

Required guardrails:
Secure AI platforms (no PHI/PII leakage)
Code scanning and SAST/DAST pipelines
Architecture review gates
Versioning and traceability
Human?in?the?loop validation
--
The enterprise path forward: structured vibe coding
Enterprise guidance emphasizes that vibe coding is viable when paired with governance, risk controls, and structured workflows.

This means:
AI generates code
Humans validate architecture, security, and compliance
Automated pipelines enforce quality
Documentation and traceability are mandatory

Enterprises are already adopting vibe coding — carefully
Enterprise vibe coding is becoming mainstream, but organizations must balance velocity with risk management.

Why enterprises like it:
Faster iteration
Lower development cost
Empowering semi?technical teams
Rapid prototyping

Why they’re cautious:
Compliance exposure
Security risks
Maintainability concerns
IP ambiguity
--
Practical guidance for regulated environments (like healthcare)
Given your interest in health?tech, here’s what the sources imply:

? Where vibe coding can work in healthcare
Internal dashboards

Non?clinical workflow tools

Data exploration prototypes

Integration scaffolding

DevOps automation scripts

Documentation generation

Test harnesses

? Where vibe coding should not be used without strict controls
Clinical decision support

Medical device software

PHI?handling services

FDA?regulated components

Safety?critical systems

Security?sensitive code paths
