---------------------------------------------------------------
Application_Hosting_Options

App Service enables you to build and host web apps, background jobs, mobile back-ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language 
of your choice without managing infrastructure. It offers automatic scaling and high availability. App Service supports Windows and 
Linux. It enables automated deployments from GitHub, Azure DevOps, or any Git repo to support a continuous deployment model.

With App Service, you can host most common App Service Styles like: Web apps, API apps, WebJobs and Mobile apps.

App Service handles most of the infrastructure decisions you deal with in hosting web-accessible apps:
	Deployment and management are integrated into the platform.
	Endpoints can be secured.
	Sites can be scaled quickly to handle high traffic loads.
	The built-in load balancing and traffic manager provide high availability.
---
App Service includes full support for hosting web apps by using ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, etc.
REST-based web APIs come with full Swagger support and the ability to package and publish your API in Azure Marketplace.

You can use the WebJobs feature to run a program (.exe, Java, PHP, Python, or Node.js) or script (.cmd, .bat, PowerShell, or Bash) 
in the same context as a web app, API app, or mobile app. They can be scheduled or run by a trigger. WebJobs are often used to 
run background tasks as part of your application logic.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Azure_Containers

Azure Container Instances offer the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure; without having to manage any virtual 
machines or adopt any additional services. Azure Container Instances are a platform as a service (PaaS) offering. Azure Container 
Instances allow you to upload your containers and then the service runs the containers for you.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a container orchestration service. An orchestration service manages the lifecycle of containers. 
When you're deploying a fleet of containers, AKS can make fleet management simpler and more efficient.

Containers are often used to create solutions by using a microservice architecture. This architecture is where you break 
solutions into smaller, independent pieces. For example, you might split a website into a container hosting your front end, 
another hosting your back end, and a third for storage. This split allows you to separate portions of your app into logical 
sections that can be maintained, scaled, or updated independently.

Imagine your website back-end reaches capacity, but the front end and storage aren't stressed. With containers, you could scale 
the back-end separately to improve performance. If something necessitated such a change, you could also choose to change the 
storage service or modify the front end without impacting any of the other components.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Azure_DNS

Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution by using Microsoft Azure infrastructure. By hosting 
your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing services.

DNS domains in Azure DNS are hosted on Azure's global network of DNS name servers, providing resiliency and high availability. 
Azure DNS uses anycast networking, so the closest available DNS server answers each DNS query, providing fast performance and 
high availability for your domain.

Azure DNS can manage DNS records for your Azure services and provide DNS for your external resources as well. Azure DNS is integrated in the Azure portal and uses the same credentials, support contract, and billing as your other Azure services.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Azure_ExpressRoute

Azure ExpressRoute lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection, with the help of 
a connectivity provider. This connection is called an ExpressRoute Circuit. This feature allows you to connect offices, 
datacenters, or other facilities to the Microsoft cloud. Each location would have its own ExpressRoute circuit.

ExpressRoute connections don't go over the public Internet. This setup allows ExpressRoute connections to offer more reliability, 
faster speeds, consistent latencies, and higher security than typical connections over the Internet.

Security
Azure DNS is based on Azure Resource Manager, which provides features such as:
Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to control who has access to specific actions for your organization.
Activity logs to monitor how a user in your organization modified a resource or to find an error when troubleshooting.
Resource locking to lock a subscription, resource group, or resource. Locking prevents other users in your organization from 
accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources.

Azure DNS can manage DNS records for your Azure services and provide DNS for your external resources as well. You can manage 
your domains and records with the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell cmdlets, and the cross-platform Azure CLI. Applications that 
require automated DNS management can integrate with the service by using the REST API and SDKs.

Customizable virtual networks with private domains
Azure DNS also supports private DNS domains. This feature allows you to use your own custom domain names in your private virtual 
networks, rather than being stuck with the Azure-provided names.

Customizable virtual networks with private domains
Azure DNS also supports private DNS domains. This feature allows you to use your own custom domain names in your private 
virtual networks, rather than being stuck with the Azure-provided names.

Important!
You can't use Azure DNS to buy a domain name. For an annual fee, you can buy a domain name by using App Service domains or 
a third-party domain name registrar. Once purchased, your domains can be hosted in Azure DNS for record management.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Azure_Virtual_Desktop

Another type of virtual machine is the Azure Virtual Desktop. Azure Virtual Desktop is a desktop and application virtualization 
service that runs on the cloud. Azure Virtual Desktop provides centralized security management for users' desktops with Microsoft 
Entra ID. You can enable multifactor authentication to secure user sign-ins. You can also secure access to data by assigning 
granular role-based access controls (RBACs) to users.
---
*Entra ID, previously known as Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), is a cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) service 
provided by Microsoft. It is designed to help organizations securely manage and authenticate users, devices, and applications 
across various environments, including on-premises, cloud, and hybrid systems. Entra ID helps organizations manage user identities, 
ensuring that employees, partners, and customers can securely access company resources across cloud and on-premises environments.

Entra ID allows for the creation, update, and deletion of user accounts, as well as the management of their attributes, roles, and 
permissions. While traditional AD is commonly used in on-premises environments, Entra ID is typically used in cloud environments to 
manage identities and access for users and applications that reside in the cloud.
---
Azure Virtual Desktop lets you use Windows 10 or Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session, the only Windows client-based operating systems 
that enables multiple concurrent users on a single VM. You can think of an Azure network as an extension of your on-premises 
network with resources that link to other Azure resources.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Azure_Virtual_Networking

Azure virtual networks and virtual subnets enable Azure resources, such as VMs, web apps, and databases, to communicate with each 
other, with users on the internet, and with your on-premises client computers. 

Azure virtual networks provide the following key networking capabilities: Isolation and segmentation, Internet communications, 
Communicate between Azure resources, Communicate with on-premises resources, network traffic routing, network traffic filtering, 
Connecting virtual networks.

Azure virtual networking supports both public and private endpoints to enable communication between external or internal resources 
with other internal resources. Public endpoints have a public IP address and can be accessed from anywhere in the world.
Private endpoints exist within a virtual network and have a private IP address from within the address space of that virtual network.

Azure virtual network(VNet) allows you to create multiple isolated virtual networks. When you set up a virtual network, you define a 
private IP address space that is in the private IP address range. The private IP range only exists within the virtual network and 
isn't internet routable. You can divide the private IP address space into subnets and allocate part of the defined address space 
to each named subnet. A subnet is defined by an IP address range, which is a subset of the IP address space of a larger network.

* A subnet, short for subnetwork, is a logical subdivision of a larger network. It is used to partition a single network into 
smaller, more manageable segments. Subnets improve network performance, enhance security, and allow better control of traffic 
flow within a network. A subnet is defined by an IP address range, which is a subset of the IP address space of a larger network.

For name resolution, you can use the name resolution service built into Azure. You also can configure the virtual network to use 
either an internal or an external DNS server. You can enable incoming connections from the internet by assigning a public IP 
address to an Azure resource, or putting the resource behind a public load balancer.

Virtual networks can connect not only VMs but other Azure resources, such as the App Service Environment for Power Apps, Azure 
Kubernetes Service, and Azure virtual machine scale sets. Service endpoints can connect to other Azure resource types, such as 
Azure SQL databases and storage accounts.

* The App Service Environment (ASE) for Power Apps in Azure provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for securely 
running Power Apps and related Azure App Service apps at scale(ability to handle increased demand or workload through horizontal
and vertical scaling).

Azure virtual networks enable you to link resources together in your on-premises environment and within your Azure subscription.
There are three mechanisms for you to achieve this connectivity:
1) Point-to-site virtual private network connections are from a computer outside your organization back into your corporate network. 
   In this case, the client computer initiates an encrypted VPN connection to connect to the Azure virtual network.

2) Site-to-site virtual private networks link your on-premises VPN device or gateway to the Azure VPN gateway in a virtual network. 
In effect, the devices in Azure can appear as being on the local network. The connection is encrypted and works over the internet.

3) Azure ExpressRoute provides a dedicated private connectivity to Azure that doesn't travel over the internet. ExpressRoute is 
useful for environments where you need greater bandwidth and even higher levels of security. Azure ExpressRoute communicates over 
dedicated, private network connections provided by a third-party connectivity provider or a colocation(data center) facility. 
The medium used is typically high-speed fiber-optic cables within the connectivity provider's network and Microsoft's global 
backbone network.
---
By default, Azure routes traffic between subnets on any connected virtual networks, on-premises networks, and the internet. You 
also can control routing and override those settings, as follows:
1) Route tables allow you to define rules about how traffic should be directed. You can create custom route tables that control 
   how packets are routed between subnets.

2) Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) works with Azure VPN gateways, Azure Route Server, or Azure ExpressRoute to propagate 
   on-premises BGP routes to Azure virtual networks.

Azure virtual networks enable you to filter network traffic between subnets by using the following approaches:
1) Network security groups are Azure resources that can contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules. You can define 
these rules to allow or block traffic, based on factors such as source and destination IP address, port, and protocol.

2) Network virtual appliances are specialized VMs that can be compared to a hardened network appliance. A network virtual 
appliance carries out a particular network function, such as running a firewall or performing wide area network (WAN) optimization.
---
Connect virtual networks
You can link virtual networks together by using virtual network peering. Peering allows two virtual networks to connect directly 
to each other. Network traffic between peered networks is private, and travels on the Microsoft backbone network, never entering 
the public internet. Peering enables resources in each virtual network to communicate with each other. These virtual networks 
can be in separate regions. This feature allows you to create a global interconnected network through Azure.

User-defined routes(UDR) allow you to control the routing tables between subnets within a virtual network or between virtual 
networks. This allows for greater control over network traffic flow.
---
* Dynamic routing automatically adjusts network paths based on changes in the network topology, making it a versatile and 
powerful method for managing network traffic. Routers exchange routing information in real time using protocols like BGP. 
This allows the network to automatically adapt to changes such as link failures or new routes.

With Dynamic routing, new routers or subnets can be added without requiring a complete reconfiguration of the routing tables.
Dynamic Routing adjusts to congestion by redistributing traffic to less congested paths and chooses the best route based on 
real-time metrics such as bandwidth, latency, or hop count.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Azure_Virtual_Private_Networks

* An Azure VPN Gateway is a specific type of network gateway in Azure that provides secure, encrypted connections between Azure 
virtual networks (VNets) and on-premises networks or other Azure VNets. It enables hybrid cloud and multi-cloud connectivity 
through Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology.

A virtual private network (VPN) uses an encrypted tunnel within another network. VPNs are typically deployed to connect two or 
more trusted private networks to one another over an untrusted network (typically the public internet). Traffic is encrypted while 
traveling over the untrusted network to prevent eavesdropping or other attacks. VPNs can enable networks to safely and securely 
share sensitive information.

A VPN gateway is a type of virtual network gateway. Azure VPN Gateway instances are deployed in a dedicated subnet of the virtual 
network and enable the following connectivity:
	Connect on-premises datacenters to virtual networks through a site-to-site connection.
	Connect individual devices to virtual networks through a point-to-site connection.
	Connect virtual networks to other virtual networks through a network-to-network connection.

All data transfer is within a VPN gateway is encrypted inside a private tunnel as it crosses the internet. You can deploy only one 
VPN gateway in each virtual network. However, you can use one gateway to connect to multiple locations, which includes other 
virtual networks or on-premises datacenters.

When setting up a VPN gateway, you must specify the type of VPN - either policy-based or route-based. The primary distinction 
between these two types is how they determine which traffic needs encryption. In Azure, regardless of the VPN type, the method of 
authentication employed is a preshared key.

Policy-based VPN gateways specify the static IP address of packets that should be encrypted through each tunnel. This type of device 
evaluates every data packet against those sets of IP addresses to choose the tunnel where that packet is going to be sent through.
---
In Route-based gateways, IPSec tunnels are modeled as a network interface or virtual tunnel interface. IP routing, which can be 
either static routes or dynamic routing protocols, decides which one of these tunnel interfaces to use when sending each packet. 
Route-based VPNs are the preferred connection method for on-premises devices. Route-based VPNs are more resilient to topology 
changes such as the creation of new subnets. Route-based VPNs rely on route tables for traffic management, making them more 
adaptable to changing network configurations. Route-based VPNs allow multiple Site-to-Site(S2S) and Point-to-site(P2S) connections 
simultaneously. 

Route-based VPNs can configure active-active connections for high availability.

Use a route-based VPN gateway if you need any of the following types of connectivity:
	VNet-to-VNet - secure communication between Azure Virtual Networks (VNets), even if they are in different regions or subscriptions.
	Use Cases:
		Connecting microservices hosted in separate VNets.
		Facilitating resource segmentation by networking VNets securely.
	
	Point-to-site connections - Allows individual devices or remote users to securely connect to an Azure Virtual Network.
	Use Cases:
		Providing remote workers secure access to Azure-hosted resources.
		Combining with Site-to-Site(S2S) for comprehensive remote and on-premises access.
	
	Multisite connections - Connects multiple on-premises locations to a single Azure Virtual Network.
	Use Cases:
		Centralizing connectivity for multiple branch offices.
		Configuring a hub-and-spoke network topology.
	Dynamic Routing Supports Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for dynamic routing, which simplifies complex routing configurations.
	Use Cases:
		Scenarios where the network topology changes frequently, and dynamic route updates are required.
		Hybrid networks with on-premises equipment supporting BGP.

	Coexistence with an Azure ExpressRoute gateway - Enables a VPN failover for Azure ExpressRoute connections.
	Use Cases:
		Providing redundancy to ensure connectivity if the ExpressRoute circuit fails.
		Connecting Azure resources in regions or subscriptions not linked to the primary ExpressRoute.

	Site-to-Site (S2S) Connections - secure, always-on connectivity between an on-premises network and an Azure virtual network.
---
If your on-premises device only supports policy-based VPNs, a policy-based VPN gateway may be required, though it has limited 
functionality compared to route-based VPNs.

Use a route-based VPN gateway for hybrid cloud connectivity, interconnecting VNets, dynamic routing (BGP), multi-site 
configurations, and failover solutions for ExpressRoute. It is the preferred option for modern, scalable, and flexible 
networking needs in Azure.

Summary: High-Availability Scenarios for Azure VPN Gateways
	Active/Standby:
	Default configuration with two VPN gateway instances (one active, one standby).
	Standby takes over during maintenance or disruptions automatically.
	Minimal downtime: a few seconds for planned maintenance; up to 90 seconds for unplanned issues.
	
	Active/Active:
	Enabled by using BGP routing protocol.
	Both instances are active, each with its own public IP address.
	High availability is enhanced with separate tunnels to each instance and an optional additional on-premises VPN device.
	
	ExpressRoute Failover:
	Configures a VPN gateway as a backup for ExpressRoute connections.
	Uses the public internet as an alternative connectivity path during ExpressRoute outages caused by physical or location-wide failures.
	
	Zone-Redundant Gateways:
	Deploys VPN gateways across availability zones for added resiliency and scalability.
	Protects against zone-level failures by separating gateways physically and logically.
	Requires specific SKUs and Standard public IP addresses instead of Basic ones.
	These options provide varying levels of redundancy and fault tolerance to ensure secure and reliable connectivity for Azure networks.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Compute_Networking_Services

VMs provide infrastructure as a service (IaaS). You can create and provision a VM in minutes when you select a preconfigured VM image.

You can group VMs together to provide high availability, scalability, and redundancy. Azure can also manage the grouping of VMs 
for you with features such as scale sets and availability sets. An application might need to handle fluctuations in demand. Shutting 
down VMs when you don't need them or quickly starting them up to meet a sudden increase in demand means you pay only for the 
resources you use.

Virtual machine scale sets let you create and manage a group of identical, load-balanced VMs. Scale sets allow you to centrally 
manage, configure, and update a large number of VMs in minutes. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease 
in response to demand, or you can set it to scale based on a defined schedule. Virtual machine scale sets also automatically deploy 
a load balancer to make sure that your resources are being used efficiently. With virtual machine scale sets, you can build 
large-scale services for areas such as compute, big data, and container workloads.
---
Virtual machine availability sets are another tool to help you build a more resilient, highly available environment. Availability 
sets are designed to ensure that VMs stagger updates and have varied power and network connectivity, preventing you from losing 
all your VMs with a single network or power failure.

Availability Sets accomplish these objectives by grouping VMs in two ways: Update Domain and Fault Domain.

Update domain: 
The update domain groups VMs that can be rebooted at the same time. This setup allows you to apply updates while 
knowing that only one update domain grouping is offline at a time. All of the machines in one update domain update at the same time. 
An update group going through the update process is given a 30-minute time to recover before maintenance on the next update domain 
starts.

Fault domain: fault domain is a logical group of hardware that shares a common single point of failure. It is used to enhance the 
availability and reliability of resources by distributing them across different fault domains, ensuring that a single hardware 
failure does not affect all instances of a resource.

The fault domain groups your VMs by common power source and network switch. By default, an Availability Set splits 
your VMs across up to three fault domains. This helps protect against a physical power or networking failure by having VMs in 
different fault domains (thus being connected to different power and networking resources). There’s no additional cost for 
configuring an availability set. You only pay for the VM instances you create.
---
An organization can extend the capabilities of its own on-premises network by creating a virtual network in Azure and adding VMs 
to that virtual network. As with running certain types of applications in the cloud and extending an on-premises network to the 
cloud, you can get significant cost savings by using an IaaS-based approach to disaster recovery. If a primary datacenter fails, 
you can create VMs running on Azure to run your critical applications and then shut them down when the primary datacenter becomes 
operational again.

VMs are also an excellent choice when you move from a physical server to the cloud (also known as lift and shift). You can create 
an image of the physical server and host it within a VM with little or no changes. Just like a physical on-premises server, you 
must maintain the VM: you’re responsible for maintaining the installed OS and software.

When you provision a VM, you’ll also have the chance to pick the resources that are associated with that VM, including:
	Size (purpose, number of processor cores, and amount of RAM)
	Storage disks (hard disk drives, solid state drives, etc.)
	Networking (virtual network, public IP address, and port configuration)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Exercises_

In this instance, you're going to use the Azure CLI. Task 1: Create a Linux virtual machine and install Nginx. Nginx is commonly 
used as a web server to serve static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) quickly and efficiently.

1) From Cloud Shell, run the following az vm create command to create a Linux VM:
	az vm create \
	--resource-group "learn-2ffbb06c-2df8-4e08-9772-93cce76be2ab" \
	--name my-vm \
	--public-ip-sku Standard \
	--image Ubuntu2204 \
	--admin-username azureuser \
	--generate-ssh-keys

2) Run the following az vm extension set command to configure Nginx on your VM:
	az vm extension set --resource-group "learn-2ffbb06c-2df8-4e08-9772-93cce76be2ab" --vm-name my-vm --name customScript --publisher Microsoft.Azure.Extensions --version 2.1 --settings '{"fileUris":["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-welcome-to-azure/master/configure-nginx.sh"]}' --protected-settings '{"commandToExecute": "./configure-nginx.sh"}'

*The step 2 command uses a Custom Script Extension to run a Bash script on your VM. Here are the contents of the script:
	#!/bin/bash

	# Update apt cache.
	sudo apt-get update

	# Install Nginx.
	sudo apt-get install -y nginx

	# Set the home page.

Functions can be either stateless or stateful. When they're stateless (the default), they behave as if they restart every time they 
respond to an event. When they're stateful (called Durable Functions), a context is passed through the function to track prior activity.

Technical_Terms

Big data refers to extremely large and complex datasets that are difficult to process, analyze, and manage using traditional data 
processing techniques or software tools. Big data typically requires advanced technologies and methods for efficient storage, 
analysis, and extraction of meaningful insights.
