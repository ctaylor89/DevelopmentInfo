VMs provide infrastructure as a service (IaaS). You can create and provision a VM in minutes when you select a preconfigured VM image.

You can group VMs together to provide high availability, scalability, and redundancy. Azure can also manage the grouping of VMs 
for you with features such as scale sets and availability sets. An application might need to handle fluctuations in demand. Shutting 
down VMs when you don't need them or quickly starting them up to meet a sudden increase in demand means you pay only for the 
resources you use.

Virtual machine scale sets let you create and manage a group of identical, load-balanced VMs. Scale sets allow you to centrally 
manage, configure, and update a large number of VMs in minutes. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease 
in response to demand, or you can set it to scale based on a defined schedule. Virtual machine scale sets also automatically deploy 
a load balancer to make sure that your resources are being used efficiently. With virtual machine scale sets, you can build 
large-scale services for areas such as compute, big data, and container workloads.

Virtual machine availability sets are another tool to help you build a more resilient, highly available environment. Availability 
sets are designed to ensure that VMs stagger updates and have varied power and network connectivity, preventing you from losing 
all your VMs with a single network or power failure.

Availability Sets accomplish these objectives by grouping VMs in two ways: Update Domain and Fault Domain.

Update domain: The update domain groups VMs that can be rebooted at the same time. This setup allows you to apply updates while 
knowing that only one update domain grouping is offline at a time. All of the machines in one update domain update at the same time. 
An update group going through the update process is given a 30-minute time to recover before maintenance on the next update domain 
starts.

Fault domain: The fault domain groups your VMs by common power source and network switch. By default, an Availability Set splits 
your VMs across up to three fault domains. This helps protect against a physical power or networking failure by having VMs in 
different fault domains (thus being connected to different power and networking resources). There’s no additional cost for 
configuring an availability set. You only pay for the VM instances you create.
---
An organization can extend the capabilities of its own on-premises network by creating a virtual network in Azure and adding VMs 
to that virtual network. As with running certain types of applications in the cloud and extending an on-premises network to the 
cloud, you can get significant cost savings by using an IaaS-based approach to disaster recovery. If a primary datacenter fails, 
you can create VMs running on Azure to run your critical applications and then shut them down when the primary datacenter becomes 
operational again.

VMs are also an excellent choice when you move from a physical server to the cloud (also known as lift and shift). You can create 
an image of the physical server and host it within a VM with little or no changes. Just like a physical on-premises server, you 
must maintain the VM: you’re responsible for maintaining the installed OS and software.

When you provision a VM, you’ll also have the chance to pick the resources that are associated with that VM, including:
	Size (purpose, number of processor cores, and amount of RAM)
	Storage disks (hard disk drives, solid state drives, etc.)
	Networking (virtual network, public IP address, and port configuration)

Big data refers to extremely large and complex datasets that are difficult to process, analyze, and manage using traditional data 
processing techniques or software tools. Big data typically requires advanced technologies and methods for efficient storage, 
analysis, and extraction of meaningful insights.
