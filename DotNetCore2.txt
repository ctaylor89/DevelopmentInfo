---------------------------------------------------
What are the things to learn when I am learning .net core 8 and already know .net MVC?

Here's a breakdown of what to focus on. You’ll find similarities but also critical changes in architecture, tooling, and 
development patterns.

🔄 Major Conceptual Differences to Focus On
1. Unified Platform (ASP.NET Core)
.NET 8 is cross-platform and unifies .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin into a single platform.

Learn how ASP.NET Core handles both web APIs and MVC in a more modular way.

Projects are typically SDK-style (simpler .csproj files).

2. Startup and Program.cs Simplification.
ASP.NET Core uses the Minimal Hosting Model (Program.cs only), eliminating Startup.cs.

Middleware and services are configured in a more linear flow.
	var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
	var app = builder.Build();
	app.MapControllers();
	app.Run();
* Learn about custom middleware, built-in ones (auth, static, etc.)

3.Dependency Injection (DI) is Built-in

Everything is DI-first. Services like DbContexts, Repositories, HttpClients, etc., are registered and injected.
Learn scoped, singleton, and transient lifetimes.

4. Minimal APIs (New in .NET 6+, enhanced in .NET 8)
Functional alternative to full MVC controllers.
Great for small APIs or microservices.
	app.MapGet("/hello", () => "Hello World!");

Important Features/Technologies to Learn

1. Endpoint Routing
	ASP.NET Core uses a central routing system for both MVC and minimal APIs.
	Supports attribute routing, conventional routing, and route constraints.

2. Configuration System
	Stronger and more flexible than Web.config.
	Environment-based configs using appsettings.{Environment}.json.

3. Logging & Monitoring
	Built-in logging providers.
	Integrates easily with Application Insights, Serilog, etc.

4. EF Core (Entity Framework Core)
	Fully revamped ORM (lighter and cross-platform).
	Learn code-first migrations, LINQ improvements, and DbContext lifecycle.

5. Middleware Pipeline
	Replace HttpModules and HttpHandlers with your own middleware logic.
		app.Use(async (context, next) =>
		{
			// custom logic
			await next();
		});

6. Authentication and Authorization
	ASP.NET Core Identity is modular.
	Learn how to use JWT, OAuth, OpenID Connect for APIs and apps.
	Integration with Azure AD is streamlined.

7. Unit Testing with xUnit or NUnit
	Dependency injection makes services easier to mock and test.
	Learn how to use TestServer or WebApplicationFactory for integration tests.

8. APIs	Minimal APIs, controllers, routing
---
Tooling & Ecosystem Changes
1. Command Line (CLI)
	dotnet new, dotnet run, dotnet build, dotnet ef (for migrations).
	You can scaffold projects and models using CLI templates.

2. Cross-Platform Development
	You can develop and run apps on Linux, macOS, Docker.
	Learn how to write Dockerfiles for ASP.NET Core apps.

3. gRPC & SignalR
	Learn gRPC for high-performance APIs.
	SignalR for real-time messaging (rewritten for Core).

4. Rate Limiting and Output Caching (new in .NET 8)
	Native middleware support for rate limiting.
	Learn AddOutputCache() and app.UseOutputCache().
---
Bonus Tips
	Avoid legacy habits: No more Global.asax, Web.config, or System.Web.
	Embrace IConfiguration, IOptions<T>, and ILogger<T>.
	If you're a WebForms or MVC5 dev, Razor Pages may feel familiar and be an easier step than MVC controllers.

	Use https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/ as your primary doc source — it’s clean and frequently updated.
---------------------------------------------------
Dependency_Injection

Here's a clean example of Dependency Injection (DI) in ASP.NET Core (.NET 8) — covering:
	Service interface and implementation
	Registering the service
	Consuming the service in a controller

1. Define a Service Interface
	public interface IGreetingService
	{
		string GetGreeting(string name);
	}

2. Implement the Service
	public class GreetingService : IGreetingService
	{
		public string GetGreeting(string name)
		{
			return $"Hello, {name}! Welcome to .NET 8.";
		}
	}

3. Register the Service in Program.cs
	var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

	// Register the service with DI container
	builder.Services.AddScoped<IGreetingService, GreetingService>();
	builder.Services.AddControllers();
	var app = builder.Build();
	app.MapControllers();
	app.Run();

4. Inject the Service into a Controller
	[ApiController]
	[Route("api/[controller]")]
	public class GreetingController : ControllerBase
	{
		private readonly IGreetingService _greetingService;

		// Constructor injection
		public GreetingController(IGreetingService greetingService)
		{
			_greetingService = greetingService;
		}

		[HttpGet("{name}")]
		public IActionResult GetGreeting(string name)
		{
			var message = _greetingService.GetGreeting(name);
			return Ok(message);
		}
	}
