In computer programming, Cohesion is a measure of how strongly-related or focused the responsibilities of a 
single module are. In object-oriented programming, if the methods that serve the given class tend to be 
similar in many aspects the class is said to have high cohesion. In a highly-cohesive system, code readability
and the likelihood of reuse is increased, while complexity is kept manageable.

Cohesion is decreased if:
* The responsibilities (methods) of a class have little in common.
* Methods carry out many varied activities, often using coarsely-grained or unrelated sets of data.

Disadvantages of low cohesion (or "weak cohesion") are:
* Increased difficulty in understanding modules.
* Increased difficulty in maintaining a system, because logical changes in the domain affect multiple modules, 
  and because changes in one module require changes in related modules.
* Increased difficulty in reusing a module because most applications won’t need the random set of operations 
  provided by a module.

Coupling is usually contrasted with cohesion. Low coupling often correlates with high cohesion, and vice versa.

Coupling can be low (also loose and weak) or high (also tight and strong). Low coupling refers to a 
relationship in which one module interacts with another module through a stable interface and does not need to 
be concerned with the other module's internal implementation. With low coupling, a change in one module will 
not require a change in the implementation of another module. Low coupling is often a sign of a well-structured 
computer system, and when combined with high cohesion, supports the general goals of high readability and 
maintainability.

Systems that do not exhibit low coupling might experience the following developmental difficulties:
* Change in one module forces a ripple of changes in other modules.
* Modules are difficult to understand in isolation.
* Modules are difficult to reuse or test because dependent modules must be included.
Low coupling may also reduce performance, and a highly-coupled system is sometimes desirable to achieve 
maximum efficiency.

Data migration is the process of transferring data between storage types, formats, or computer systems. It 
is a key consideration for any system implementation, upgrade, or consolidation.
