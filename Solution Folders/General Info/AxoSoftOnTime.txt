To filter by a team member - All Items should be displayed\enabled in the upper left side. Mouse over the Assigned to

Those two tasks do not show up for me under archive.

I think I might see why
on the Organize > Projects tab (by default it's on the left side of the screen) - it's got the folder with your name and the Europe, Implementation, and Stateside subfolders under it
I'm guessing that you have the Stateside subfolder selected
instead
select the Craig Taylor folder
it will display the contents of that folder and all of it's subfolders
at least one of those two tasks was in the Craig Taylor folder and not the Craig Taylor > Stateside folder - the testers manually move them back when they close the tickets - they probably miss-clicked
