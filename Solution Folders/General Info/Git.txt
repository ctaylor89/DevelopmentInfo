git clone -b "<branch>" "<git repo url>"
git add .
git status
git commit -m "message"
git restore <file path and file name>            to restore an unstaged file
git restore --staged <file path and file name>   to unstage a file

git push -u  - return the repository after modifying it.
git push origin <Branch Name>
git push -u origin <branch name> - Pushing a new branch to repository.
git push --all   Push all branches to repository.

git pull - refresh the local repository including all tracking branches. You are fetching the last modified repository.
           *Run git status before a git pull. Changes that are not committed can be overwritten during a git pull.
Branching_
git branch <branch name> -creates a new branch off of the current branch.
git branch - lists all branches in local repository. Current selected branch is in green letters.
git branch -a  - lists all branches in origin repository.
git checkout <branch name> - lets you navigate between the branches created by git branch. Checking out a branch updates the files
in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch, and it tells Git to record all new commits on that
branch. Think of it as a way to select which line of development you’re working on.

git fork  - Means you are copying the repository to your Github account.

git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> Dev
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> Dev

Notes_

git pull origin master      -- status: 3 files changed, 33 insertions, 17 deletions
git status                  -- you branch is ahead of origin/Boss by 28 commits
git push -u             
git status                  -- Your branch is up to date with 'origin/Boss-1614'

Tracking branches are local branches that have a direct relationship to a remote branch. If you're on a tracking branch 
and type git pull , Git automatically knows which server to fetch from and which branch to merge in.
