// Personal Tips
Likeable people know who they are.They are confident enough to be comfortable in their own skin.By 
concentrating on what drives you and makes you happy as an individual, you become a much more interesting 
person than if you attempt to win people over by making choices that you think will make them like you."

People gravitate toward those who are passionate.That said, it’s easy for passionate people to come across 
as too serious or uninterested because they tend to get absorbed in their work.Likeable people balance their 
passion with the ability to have fun.At work they are serious, yet friendly.They still get things done because 
they are socially effective in short amounts of time and they capitalize on valuable social moments.They minimize 
small talk and gossip and instead focus on having meaningful interactions with their coworkers.They remember what 
you said to them yesterday or last week, which shows that you’re just as important to them as their work.

// Professional Tips
"Technology Association of Georgia http://www.tagonline.org/"
"I've made a huge number of professional contacts via that organization, as well as by being a"
"member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers."
"Probably the most interesting contacts I make outside of the professional world is via Toastmasters."

"The best engineer I ever worked with had no degree or certification. He was self-taught "
"and had hands-on experience. I don't care about the education aspect of a candidate but "
"their communication skills, level of interest in what we're doing, technical ability, "
"and whether they're comfortable and able to work in a group atmosphere." 

"Programming, like any other talent, is independent of the person's gender, race, or "
"country of origin. I have worked with some really bad programmers who were born in the "
"U.S., UK, Germany, India, Russia, and, yes, China. What separates a good programmer from "
"a bad programmer is passion for programming and only a portion of the programming "
"population have that."


"Problem-solve"
"The quiet of the morning is often the time when your mind is at its clearest and most"
"well-suited to solving important problems. Steve Murphy, CEO of publishing company "
"Rodale, says, \"A line in a William Blake poem inspired me to think differently about"
"my day: ‘Think in the morning, act in the noon, read in the evening, and sleep at night.'"
"This has made a huge difference in my life. Now, I take out a yellow pad every morning "
"and write my thoughts for the day, which allows me to be much more strategic and "
"proactive than reactive."

"Just the fact that you're reading articles on Dobbs Code Talk puts you in the elite of your profession. "
"It's pretty well accepted that most programmers don't read programming books, visit programming web sites,"
" or participate in online forums."
"Of course, it's also pretty well accepted that most programmers aren't that great. And this lack of"
" interest in the profession probably has a lot to do with it."

"An expert programmer is no longer someone who is really knowledgeable or experienced. All too often, an "
"expert programmer is the person who is adept at using a variety of reference tools and documentation to "
"find out how to achieve their goals. This is my secret sauce. I am really good at looking at a problem,"
"figuring out approximately what is wrong, and being able to quickly find the solution."
"If anyone were to watch me write code, they would assume that I am an idiot, since it would definitely "
"look like I was grasping at straws 50% of the time. To be honest, that is what it feels like."

"The key differentiator between me and a lot of the other people I’ve met in this industry, is the degree "
"of enthusiasm. I like this work enough to devote significant portions of my non-work hours programming, "
"learning about programming, or writing about programming."

"Alvin Toffler, in his groundbreaking book Future Shock, added the word 'overchoice' to our vocabulary. The "
"idea was that the sheer number of options that we now have makes life harder, not easier, because we have "
"to spend precious time and energy just deciding which option to concentrate on before making any progress "
"on the original problem. It gets worse if we pick the wrong option and have to back up and try again."

This is a problem that we see a lot in .NET as well as programming in general these days.

Startup Disease 1: The Imaginary User Syndrome
A product that’s not geared towards a specific user is unlikely to benefit anyone in particular; hence, 
there’s no such thing as a generic user. No matter how great your initial vision might seem, if you don’t 
have a target audience in mind, your startup will lack direction and flounder. In addition, it’s 
difficult to market to everyone, so not only will your product suffer, it’ll be hard to sell too.

Symptoms:
Your product is targeted at all or most small businesses online. 
You don’t know any of your likely users personally, but you’re sure they’ll find your product very useful. 
Your product seems so versatile that it will be useful to practically anyone. 

Cure:
Stop developing until you’ve established a small, defined set of users who could benefit from your product. 
Then contact these users and convince them to test-drive your site. Tailor the product so that it benefits 
them, and chances are it will appeal to other like-minded users.

// Tips to make yourself more visible to recruiters and employers
1. Post your resume on more than one site and then create a free gmail account for managing your job search 
and/or networking and to cut down on the spam you are sure to receive.

2. Build profiles on LinkedIn, Naymz, Plaxo, etc. Dingee suggests making your profiles public because many 
employers don’t pay to use II’s recruiter module, opting instead for free techniques like XRay to find 
people. If you use MySpace and Facebook, be careful that you don’t post inappropriate stuff.

3. Put yourself out there (online) with Pipl.com. Dingee says that Pipl, a people search engine, is so good 
that it will “probably scare some people’s pants off when they see what information it is able to legally 
drudge up.” The word-of-mouth on Pipl is so good that it leads in the U.S. with 557K unique users. That’s 
compared to Spock’s 260K. Pipl produces not only links to all of your profiles on social networks like 
Facebook and LinkedIn, but it includes blog mentions and photos on Flickr. Be forewarned that it also 
finds mentions of your name in public records. This would not be a problem unless, as it was in my case, 
your name is shared by an inmate at the Alabama Department of Corrections.

/* Thirteen years ago I went into a bank and gave flowers to a teller that worked there. She 
may have been counting money at the time, but I don't think either one of us counted on having 
so many great years together. What an experience it has been. In all of our activities and 
adventures(including attempted adventures), it has truly been a blessing to have shared life's 
many moments with you. Your encouragement, thought fullness, caring and supportive nature 
combined with your spirit of adventure and heart felt dedication to our relationship is 
constantly noticed and appreciated more than I could possibly express with words. You are my 
best friend and have exceeded all my expectations for a good marriage. I look forward to the 
next thirteen years together. Happy Valentines Day*/

// Book Review: Pragmatic Thinking and Learning
The very nature of learning itself is examined next, and Hunt lashes out against corporate training 
and certification programs as ineffective ways to actually learn anything of long-lasting value. 
Instead, he posits, learning should be deliberate and continual. Surely this isn't a surprise to 
anyone who has taken the time to seek out this book in the first place or read this review. 
Learning by teaching and "learning by playing" are also stressed. Different learning biases are 
examined, and concepts like mind maps are introduced that can be helpful in organizing your thoughts. 
Personally I've never really seen a lot of value in "formal" mind mapping, but carrying around a 
simple unlined notebook and getting into the regular habit of scribbling down thoughts down is 
something everyone should try. Re-transcribing and expanding on those notes later provides even 
further value.

Managing Focus, the penultimate chapter of the book, is probably one of its strongest, and a good way 
to wrap things up with more immediately useful practical advice. Hunt describes tips for using 
meditation and purposeful defocusing (and non-goal-directed thinking) to increase overall awareness 
and take advantage of r-mode thinking. He also mentions, albeit briefly, the GTD philosophy, and
discusses the benefits of using note-taking devices and Wikis to "increase exocortex storage". 
What good is encyclopedic knowledge of a programming language syntax, after all, when you can just use 
an external reference to easily look that information up? True knowledge is vastly different than 
mere memorization, and we should always farm out what we can to external sources.

Probably the most important point that Hunt raises here is the importance of  context in our daily work. 
Focusing on a single task at a time with minimal interruptions raises productivity significantly. As 
humans, we are truly truly awful at multi-tasking (I can personally confirm this); instead of trying to 
juggle too many simultaneous tasks, we should instead just avoid it whenever possible. Context 
switches are costly -- Hunt reports that it often takes upwards of 20 minutes to reload context the 
context stack -- and the benefits of being constantly interrupted rarely outweigh the costs of the 
consequentual productivity losses. Hunt advises us to set aside certain safe times for phone calls, 
emails, and other bits of necessary communication (along with other tips for proper single task 
management), and that by doing so not only will our productivity increase but our stress levels will 
decrease accordingly.

I'd definitely recommend Pragmatic Thinking and Learning to fellow developers who are interested in 
pushing the limits of their personal productivity, or just to anyone who might be interested in the 
basics of human learning processes and cognitive science.


// Think! About Your Work
In order to be a Pragmatic Programmer, we are challenging you to 'think about what you are doing' while you are 
doing it. This isn't a one-time audit of current practices---it's an ongoing critical appraisal of every 
decision you make, every day, and on every development. Never run on auto-pilot. Constantly be thinking, 
critiquing your work in real time. The old IBM corporate motto, THINK!, is the Pragmatic Programmer's mantra.

If this sounds like hard work to you, then you're exhibiting the realistic characteristic. This is going to 
take up some of your valuable time---time that is probably already under tremendous pressure. The reward is 
a more active involvement with a job you love, a feeling of mastery over an increasing range of subjects, and 
pleasure in a feeling of continuous improvement. Over the long term, your time investment will be repaid as 
you and your team become more efficient, write code that's easier to maintain, and spend less time in meetings. 

Some people feel that there is no room for individuality on large teams or complex projects. "Software 
construction is an engineering discipline," they say, "that breaks down if individual team members make 
decisions for themselves. We disagree. The construction of software should be an engineering discipline. 
However, this doesn't preclude individual craftsmanship. Think about the large cathedrals built in Europe 
during the Middle Ages. Each took thousands of person-years of effort, spread over many decades. Lessons 
learned were passed down to the next set of builders, who advanced the state of structural engineering with 
their accomplishments. But the carpenters, stonecutters, carvers, and glass workers were all craftspeople, 
interpreting the engineering requirements to produce a whole that transcended the purely mechanical side of 
the construction. It was their belief in their individual contributions that sustained the projects: We who cut 
mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals.

Within the overall structure of a project there is always room for individuality and craftsmanship. This is 
particularly true given the current state of software engineering. One hundred years from now, our engineering 
may seem as archaic as the techniques used by medieval cathedral builders seem to today's civil engineers, 
while our craftsmanship will still be honored. It's a Continuous Process 

// From the Mediocre Programmer article
I believe in high standards. By my standards I am a mediocre programmer. Sit me down in front of a computer 
and I can do a darned decent job coding. Ask me some basic but specific coding question in the hall and I 
will probably be at a loss for an answer.

I am sooo pleased to find that I am not alone! I get so cross with these C++ nerds who sneer at me because 
I have not buried my stuff in an abstruse function holding a mult-dimensional array. 

I have to say that I have been programming a LONG time and have recently (within the last 7 or 8 years) 
"reinvented" myself back to what I always enjoyed in this business - regular old "programming".

I've encountered programmers with various levels of skill and knowledge. I don't feel I can comment on my 
own programming skills other than to say that they've kept me in employment for over 30 years, the last 10+ 
with my present employer, so I must be doing something right. My strong point is that I can communicate with 
users in non-technical language, something some programmers [I've known] seem incapable of doing. I accept 
criticism without treating it as a personal attack and generally get on well with management too, even when 
they give me totally unrealistic deadlines which I usually fail to meet, only to discover that the client 
(for whom the software was written) isn't ready for it, so I have time to complete the job without 
disappointing the client. I enjoy programming.

Great post! I think 80% of the developers I've worked with fall into this camp.

The best programmers are the ones who truly love to program.

The problem: People on both sides of the political aisle often work backward from a firm 
conclusion to find supporting facts, rather than letting evidence inform their views.

A totally rational person would lay out - and evaluate objectively - the pros and cons of 
a health care overhaul before choosing to support or oppose a plan

"People get deeply attached to their beliefs," Hoffman said. "We form emotional attachments 
that get wrapped up in our personal identity and sense of morality, irrespective of the 
facts of the matter."

And to keep our sense of personal and social identity, Hoffman said, we tend to use a 
backward type of reasoning in order to justify such beliefs.

Similarly, past research by Dolores Albarracin, a psychology professor at the University 
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has shown in particular that people who are less confident 
in their beliefs are more reluctant than others to seek out opposing perspectives. So these 
people avoid counter evidence all together.

Just about everybody is vulnerable to the phenomenon of holding onto our beliefs even 
in the face of iron-clad evidence to the contrary, Hoffman said. Why? Because it's hard to 
do otherwise. "It's an amazing challenge to constantly break out the Nietzschean hammer and 
destroy your world view and belief system and evaluate others,"

Motivated reasoning is essentially starting with a conclusion you hope to reach and then 
selectively evaluating evidence in order to reach that conclusion,"

For either side, logical arguments might not be the key.

I think strategically its important to pay attention to how people feel and the symbolism 
they are seeing, and not just the nuts and bolts of the decision. People do not reason with 
pure facts and logic alone. 

You may be a great designer, programmer, architect or manager, but if you can’t show progress and convey ideas to clients, 
you will fail. Clients need feedback. They need to see where you are heading with the project. Telling them is one thing; 
showing them is another. Many potentially great websites were derailed because the designer did not effectively explain 
what was happening to the client. Show, don’t tell. No matter how much head-nodding you see, if you only tell your clients 
what you will do, they’ll be confused later. Either poor memory or communication will sink your ship every time.

______________________________________________________________________

Make sure you are getting feedback on your work and you know you are on track with what you are working on. Ask for feedback. 
That means ASK. "Do you feel I'm on track with X? Are you happy with what you're seeing with Y?" It's hard but it's important.

A wise woodcutter indeed is he who rather than constantly chopping wood will occasionally stop to sharpen his axe. Leaders 
that can appreciate the value of stillness can move forward and sustain momentum after pausing.

“I insist on a lot of time being spent, almost every day, to just sit and think. That is very uncommon in American business. I 
read and think. So I do more reading and thinking, and make less impulse decisions than most people in business." -Warren Buffet.

The moment we believe that success is determined by an ingrained level of ability as opposed to resilience and hard work, we 
will be brittle in the face of adversity. Read more at http ://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/keywords/hard_work_2.html#FdP9aSfkCj12pE3H.99
