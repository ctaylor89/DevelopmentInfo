POWERSHELL SCRIPT ENVIRONMENT

PowerShell is the preferred method of performing Windows administration tasks (docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/
overview?view=powershell-7). It has also become the Windows hacker's go-to toolkit. PowerShell statements can be executed at 
a PowerShell prompt, or run as a script (.ps1) on any PowerShell-enabled host.

The Get-Help cmdlet shows help on different elements of the PowerShell environment.

Cmdlets and Functions
Most PowerShell usage is founded on cmdlets. A cmdlet is a compiled library that exposes some configuration or administrative 
task, such as starting a VM in Hyper-V. Cmdlets use a Verb-Noun naming convention. Cmdlets always return an object. Typically, 
the return from a cmdlet will be piped to some other cmdlet or function. For example:

Get-Process | Where { $_.name -eq 'nmap' } | Format-List

Cmdlets such as Invoke-Expression, Invoke-Command, Invoke-WMIMethod, New-Service, Create-Thread, Start-Process, and New-Object 
can indicate an attempt to run some type of binary shellcode. cmdlets can be shortened. For example, Invoke-Expression can be 
run using IEX.

You can also define simple functions for use within your scripts. Custom functions are declared within curly brackets:

function Cat-Name {
  param ($name,$surname)
  return $name + ' ' + $surname
}

#This ends the function declaration; the next statement calls it

$greeting = 'Hello ' + $(Cat-Name('World',''))
Write-Host $greeting

Note that a variable is declared by prefixing a label with $. 

Logic and Looping Statements
PowerShell supports a wider range of branching and looping structures than Python, including the switch and do statements. 
Curly braces are used to structure the statements. PowerShell uses textual operators (-eq, -ne, -lt, -gt, -le, and -ge).

Modules
PowerShell can also be used with a large number of modules, which are added to a script using the Import-Module cmdlet.
