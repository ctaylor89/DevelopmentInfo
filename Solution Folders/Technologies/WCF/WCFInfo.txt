Behaviors
http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/443576/Implementing-WCF-Service-Behaviors


Every behavior has a class behind it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bindings

Every binding has a class behind it.
WCF binding is a set of binding elements and each element specify, how the service and client will communicates with each other's. 
Each binding must have at least one transport element and one message encoding element.

If an endpoint does not specify a binding configuration and there is a binding configuration that is the same type of transport and 
is unnamed, it will be used by default. When you make changes to a binding configuration you must make changes on both ends, client 
and server. If you have a different timeout setting between the client and server or a different message size setting, the smaller 
setting will generally be used.

WCF Reliable Sessions Bindings: service and client side receiveTimeout and inactivityTimeout
http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/749527/WCF-Reliable-Sessions-Bindings-service-and-client

If you are using a non-reliable binding you only need to worry about the receive time. If you are using a reliable binding you need 
to worry about inactivity timeout as well as receive time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Golden rule: one .svc = one service (or more specifically: one service implementation class).
You can have one service implementation class that implements multiple service contracts.

svc files are used when you host your WCF service in IIS. There's a module within IIS that handles the .svc file. Actually, it 
is the ASPNET ISAPI Module, which hands off the request for the .svc file to one of the handler factory types that has been 
configured for ASPNET.

In the svc file:
Service = <Namespace>.<contract implementation class>

// Example svc file contents:
<%@ ServiceHost Language="C#" Debug="true" Service="FX.BusinessService.Services.ConfirmationReportService" 
    CodeBehind="~/Services/Reports/ConfirmationReportService.cs" %>


If you use WCF 4.0(Visual Studio 2010) you don't have to create configuration (default will be used) and you even don't need to define .svc file. 
WCF 4.0 supports configuration based activation. Asp.net will add a reference to System.ServiceModelActivation for you. You can now "simulate" 
the .svc via config creating a virtual svc file with the following:

<system.serviceModel>
   <!-- bindings, endpoints, behaviors -->
   <serviceHostingEnvironment >
      <serviceActivations>
         <add relativeAddress="MyService.svc" service="MyAssembly.MyService"/>
      </serviceActivations>
   </serviceHostingEnvironment>
</system.serviceModel>

Then you don't need a physical .svc file nor a global.asax
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Error_handling

http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/799258/WCF-Exception-FaultException-FaultContract

FaultException and Exception

Exception and FaultException are not the same. If we throw a normal exception from a WCF service then the client who consumes that service 
will be receiving a generic error which will not give any details regarding the issue. Instead we should use FaultException which will 
give a formatted exception to the client as it is serialized.

MSDN suggests that no unexpected exceptions (like OutOfMemoryException, ArgumentNullException or InvalidOperationException) should be 
caught when using a service client.  Typically on the client there is no useful way to handle unexpected errors, so typically you should 
not catch them when calling a WCF client communication method.

Use Close always for a clean path of code execution. Use Abort in case of a faulted channel, or if your code threw an error. As you 
might know, if you call Close on a faulted channel, it will throw another error, Close is a graceful shutdown of channel, whereas Abort 
is an instant shut down of the channel.

// Throw FaultException from service

        Message = string.Format("Invalid Credentials - Service failed to authenticate client"),
        LoginName = logInName,
        Reason = authEx.ToString()
    };

    log.ErrorFormat("ServiceMethod: {0} {1} Name: {2} ", fault.ServiceMethod, fault.Message, fault.Reason);                
    throw new FaultException<LoginFault>(fault, new FaultReason("Service failed to authenticate client"));
}

// Handle FaultException on client side
catch (FaultException<LoginFault> fex)
{
    log.ErrorFormat("{0}: Login to service by client failed. {1}", MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod().Name, fex.Detail.Reason);

Hosting

creating and deploying wcf service on aws


What host should I use to deploy a wcf service to aws?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implementation Steps

Question:
I have created a new "WCF service library" type project. I have created a file for my contract and a file which implements the interface.
How do I consume it and where should I put my .svc file?

You have to create another project - Web application or WCF Service application (generally it is same as Web application with some added 
references). Then you have to reference your service library in the new project and add the .svc file. Delete code behind file from newly 
created .svc file and open markup of that file. Modify Service attribute of @ServiceHost directive. The attribute has to point to your 
service implemented in library (full name with namespace). Then add configuration to web config.

If you use WCF 4.0 you don't have to create configuration (default will be used) and you even don't need to define .svc file. WCF 4.0 
supports configuration based activation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Message Contract
WCF uses SOAP message for communication. Most of the time the developer concentrates more on developing the DataContract, Serializing the 
data, etc. Some times the developer will also need control over the SOAP message format. In that case WCF provides Message Contract to 
customize the message as per requirement. 

A Message Contract is used to control the structure of a message body and serialization process. It is also used to send / access 
information in SOAP headers. By default WCF takes care of creating SOAP messages according to service DataContracts and OperationContracts. 

A SOAP message is an ordinary XML document containing the following elements:
Envelope	Identifies the XML document as a SOAP message.									Required
Header		Contains header information.													Not Required
Body		Contains call, and response information.										Required
Fault		Provides information about errors that occurred while processing the message.	Not Required

// Example message
POST /InStock HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.org
Content-Type: application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 299
SOAPAction: "http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope"
 
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope">
  <soap:Header>
  </soap:Header>
  <soap:Body>
    <m:GetStockPrice xmlns:m="http://www.example.org/stock">
      <m:StockName>IBM</m:StockName>
    </m:GetStockPrice>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>

You can't use net.tcp with cassini, so there is no change you can make to allow it to work. You'll have to use IIS on your machine.
For anyone that stumbles accross this, my guide to trouble-shooting net.tcp WCF issues like this:

You can do it using a self-hosted service. If you build most of your service in a library, it's pretty easy to be able to build two 
versions - one self-hosted (for debugging), and one hosted using WAS/IIS.
---
Check that net.tcp is an enabled protocol for the web site (in IIS, right-click the site, goto advanced settings, and ensure that 
Enabled Protocols includes "net.tcp". I'm not sure if this is a paranoia thing, I also have always needed to enable net.tcp for the 
Site via the command line as well as step 1. Open a command prompt, and from c:\windows\system32\inetsrv, enter appcmd.exe set app 
"NameOfWebsite/" /enabledProtocols:http,net.tcp.
Check that the bindings for the website in IIS have an entry for net.tcp, and that you've bound it to the correct port number.
Also check that no other websites in IIS are using the same net.tcp binding to that port
Check that the "Net.TCP Listener Adapter" service is running.
---
net.tcp://localhost:808/CalculatorService.svc

Use this from the cmd line to see if a certain port number is being listened to:
	netstat -ona | find "9050"
This will return some stats if there is a port at that number.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Notes

// Use this when running service in VS host.
Configuration rootConfig = ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration(ConfigurationUserLevel.None);
// Use this when running service in IIS. It only opens the Web.Config file that is deployed.
Configuration rootConfig = WebConfigurationManager.OpenWebConfiguration("/");

	
This doesn't work, this code opens config in %systemdisk%/inetpub/wwwroot/web.config, and it is not the config that I need. When I do it with parameter HttpContext.Current.Request.ApplicationPath it returns another web.config. – Lubochkn Andrew Nov 9 '11 at 8:48 
 		
I replace "/" with "~" and it works! Configuration config = WebConfigurationManager.OpenWebConfiguration("~"); – Lubochkn Andrew Nov 9 '11 at 11:15 
 		
Yes "/" gets the root web.config, not the current application's web.config, whereas "~" seems to work. –

WCF's built-in custom token or federation security is designed for SOAP based services. You can find some samples about using WCF federation or 
custom token in the .NET Framework WCF & WCF samples. I would recommend you also take a look at the WIF (windows identity foundation) which as 
encapsulated part of the WCF federation and identity based authorization features and provide a more generic and unified identity based 
authorization solution:

Intranet Security

In this example:
 <security mode="Transport">
    <transport clientCredentialType="Windows" protectionLevel="EncryptAndSign" />
    <message clientCredentialType="Windows" />
</security>

clientCredentialType - How the client will authenticate to the service: None, Certificate and Windows.
protectionLevel - How the message is protected: EncryptAndSign, Signed and None.

Security is applied at the endpoint level. The endpoint relates the binding to the contract. Security is specified in the binding.
Security on tcp bindings is set to transport by default.

TraceListener

You should use system.diagnostics section. Here's example from MSDN for text file
<configuration>
  <system.diagnostics>
    <trace autoflush="false" indentsize="4">
      <listeners>
        <add name="myListener" 
          type="System.Diagnostics.TextWriterTraceListener" 
          initializeData="TextWriterOutput.log" />
        <remove name="Default" />
      </listeners>
    </trace>

This is for system events log: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.eventlogtracelistener.aspx
	
I still got no log file output until I turned off custom errors. <system.web><customErrors mode="Off"/>

WCF Service Library

What is the main difference between a WCF service library and WCF service application?
A Service Application includes a website host already setup for you. A service library is a library of services that a host can 
reference and startup. 

A WCF Service Library is a project for creating a host-independent service class library (.dll) that can run within a variety hosts.
A WCF Service Application is a project for creating a service application that is hosted in IIS/WAS.

http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/154870/WCF-Service-Library-A-Good-Approach-for-WCF-Servic
Using WCF library is a good approach for any WCF project because doing so makes the WCF service implementation code easily reused flexibly 
under different practical scenarios. Also using WCF library in a WCF web service application is doable and easy.

There is a misconception that WCF library can only be consumed by WCF service application projects. This isn't true. WCF library can be 
used in the same way as using a regular .NET library by any other type of .NET project. 

If you start with a service library (recommended) you can then choose any host you wish (a windows service, IIS/ASP.NET, or even 
a console application) and you'd just reference your library from your new host. Choosing a Service Application limits your host 
to just IIS/ASP.NET. 

A WCF Service Library has to be hosted in order to be used - you can host it in IIS, a Windows Service or some self-hosted option 
(like a console app, WinForm, WPF, etc).

This article explains the difference between a Service Application and a Service Library. It also explains where we should use Service 
Applications and where to use a Service Library
http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/uploadfile/db2972/wcf-difference-between-service-application-and-service-lib/

The major difference is that the WCF Service Application has a .svc file, whereas the Service Library does not have a .svc file.
Suppose we want to host this service application in IIS, then you need to specify for IIS the execution runtime environment requirements. 
In a web application we set an .aspx, similarly for a Service Application we need to set a .svc.

A WCF Service Library is not hosted by the ASP.Net development server. It is hosted by the Test Client, since a Service Library does not have an .svc file. 

The WCF Service Application template can be used to create WCF services with a hosting website created within the project

The WCF Service Library template can be used to create WCF services that are hosted by the WCF Service Host, and these can be tested using the WCF service 
Test Client.

For a more detailed answer explaining the difference between a WCF Service Library and WCF Service Application check out the following link:
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/echarran/archive/2007/09/18/how-to-arrange-a-solution-using-the-wcf-service-library-and-wcf-service-application-templates.aspx

For an explanation of other options other than using templates to host the WCF Service Library then check out this link:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19944606/combining-wcf-service-library-and-wcf-service-application

For an explanation of how to host it and publish the WCF Service, check out this link: 
http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/dhananjaycoder/walkthrough-on-creating-wcf-4-0-service-and-hosting-in-iis-7-5/

You should be able to follow these links pretty much step-by-step. I was able to skip the second method and use both the WCF Service Libary and the WCF 
Service Application and then follow the steps in the last link. I hope this information helps someone speed up there research. It took me several days 
to figure all his out and I have two books I've read on the subject.

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb924405(v=vs.110).aspx

The WCF service library project provids an App.config file for the library during development. However, the 
App.config file is not recognized after deployment. You have to move your configuration code into the configuration 
file recognized by your hosting environment. For self-hosting, you should copy the contents of the App.config file 
into the App.config file of the hosting executable. If you use IIS to host your service, you should copy the contents 
of the App.config file into the Web.config file of the virtual directory.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unit Testing WCF

Golden rule of testability - Do not instantiate dependencies. Dependencies need to be injected in.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ClientCode

using JobsDBService.Client.JobsDBServiceReference;
using System.ServiceModel;

namespace JobsDBService.Client
{
    public class JobsDBServiceClient
    {
        ServiceContractClient JobsDbService = new JobsDBServiceReference.ServiceContractClient();   // Get type name from service ref in object browser.
    }
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuration_

If you are using IIS to host your service, use a Web.config file. If you are using any other hosting environment, use an App.config file.

In a hosting environment, it is the host's config that we are most concerned about. For example when the Host's
service calls into the data repository, the data repository will need a connection string. The connection string
will be stored in the host config file. The config file in the host is for the host application and the services 
it uses. 

Web Service Configuration
You need a reference to System.ServiceModel and System.ServiceModel.Activation. The latter to add a virtual svc file.
 <serviceHostingEnvironment>
    <serviceActivations>
       <add service="GeoLib.Services.GeoManager" relativeAddress="GeoService.svc"/>
    </serviceActivations>
 </serviceHostingEnvironment>
---
IIS Configuration
Most commonly, XML elements are added to the Web.config file for an Internet Information Services (IIS) site that hosts a WCF service.

When hosted in IIS, endpoint addresses are always considered to be relative to the address of the .svc file that represents the service. 
For example, if the base address of a WCF service is http://localhost/Application1/MyService.svc with the following endpoint configuration:
    <endpoint address="anotherEndpoint" /> then the endpoint can be reached at http://localhost/Application1/MyService.svc/anotherEndpoint

Similarly, the endpoint configuration element that uses an empty string as the relative address provides an endpoint reachable at 
http://localhost/Application1/MyService.svc, which is the base address. Ex: <endpoint address="" />

You must always use relative endpoint addresses for IIS-hosted service endpoints. Supplying a fully-qualified endpoint address (for example, 
http://localhost/MyService.svc) can lead to errors in the deployment of the service if the endpoint address does not point to the IIS-application 
that hosts the service exposing the endpoint.

 Unmatched combinations of IIS settings and WCF endpoint settings result in an error during service activation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Connection_Trouble_Shooting

Client and service run together on same machine

Check these items in configurations:

client endpoint address
service base address (same as client endpoint address)
Endpoint references correct binding

binding
 Same on both client and service
 Security tag

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extend the ClientBase<TChannel> class to create a custom WCF client object that can be used to connect to a service. 
Typically, the WCF client base class is extended by using a tool such as the ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we are using IIS6 or previous version then the major drawback of IIS6.0 hosting is that only HTTP/HTTPS protocol 
can be used to communicate with the service. Which actually is sufficient for most of the projects, but if the project 
needs to communicate to the service using other protocols then this IIS6.0 hosting will not suffice.

Now the point to notice in the above text is that I specifically mentioned IIS 6.0 or previous. The reason for this is 
that IIS 7.0 comes with a feature/component called Windows Activation Service(WAS). So hosting a WCF service in WAS and 
IIS 7.0 are actually not exclusive. TO host a WCF service using WAS, we need to still host the service in IIS 7.0 and 
then enable the support for protocols other than HTTP/HTTPS. Hosting in WAS comes with all the benefits of hosting in 
IIS and on top of that it supports all the protocols too.

Self hosting has the major benefits of providing us full control. All the 
control of starting the service, stopping the service and error handling/logging can be done in a host application. 
The amount of code that needs to be written to self host a WCF service is very small and it is very easy too. Now the 
decision for chooing self hosting is purely on the requirements of whether or not you want so much control on the service.

Hosting the service in a windows service is same as self hosting but the service creation and disposing will be 
abstracted in form of a Windows service. It provides the same capabilities as a self hosted service provides and the 
decision of whether to use this method or not will rely on the same factors of whether or not you want so much control 
on the service.

Creating the Service Library

We can always keep the service code in the host application (in case of self hosting) or inside an ASP.NET 
website(IIS hosting) but it is always a good idea to have the WCF service in a class library. That way we decouple the 
service implementation from its host application. Also, we can have a single WCF service and multiple host applications 
hosting that service.

When we create a WCF service library some default configuration with endpoints, address and Bindings get created in the 
library's App.config file.

<service name="SampleServiceNamespace.SampleService">
    <endpoint address="" binding="wsHttpBinding" contract="SampleServiceNamespace.ISampleService"> 
</endpoint>

Now this configuration will be used when we try to run a service library and Visual studio will take care of hosting this 
service for us for testing purpose. The important point here is that when we host this service ourselves then this App.config 
configuration will be of no use. The host application will have to define its own endpoints and specify the Address, Binding 
and Contracts separately. 

To host a service in IIS, create a new WCF Service website. Select WCF Service. Now this web service comes with its own 
predefined service template but we are not going to use them so we will delete all of them and then add a reference to our 
service library project in this website.

Once we have the reference to our service library added, its time to create a service and configure endpoints with required 
address, binding and contracts. Since we will host this website in the IIS, the address of the .SVC file will become the 
address of the Service. Now the binding used by default when we try to host a service in IIS is basicHttpBinding. And for 
the contract part, we need to specify the contract that should be used from our service library. This can be done by changing 
the SVC file and pointing the SVC file to the right service implementation.

<%@ ServiceHost Language="C#" Debug="true" Service="SampleServiceNamespace.SampleService"%>

And this will suffice for the service to run within IIS. If we configure this website in IIS and run the .svc file the service 
will start running hosted in the IIS.

Test Client
To set up your own client, run the service in non-debug. Open the running host dialog and copy the Metadata address. Paste the address 
into the service reference that you are adding to the client project.

To enable VS to use your client and stop using the WcfTestClient.exe do the following:
Go to service properties - debug tab - Command line arguments. Replace /client:"WcfTestClient.exe" 
with /client:"..\..\..\ClientName\bin\debug\ClientName.exe". Take client out of the start up projects.

/client:"..\..\..\DatumPipe.Job.Client\bin\DebugDatumPipe.Job.ServiceClient.exe"

Need to better understand wcf library versus wcf service. Why would I deploy a wcf rather than a wcf library? What are the advantages?

Why is there no svc file in my wcf service? I know one is no longer needed.

WSDL
In the context of a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service, a WSDL (Web Services Description Language) document plays a crucial role. Here’s what you need to know:

WSDL: It’s an XML-based language used to define interfaces for web services. Essentially, WSDL describes the operations offered by a service, including input/output parameters, data types, and communication protocols. Think of it as a machine-readable blueprint for your service12.
When you work with WCF, it automatically generates WSDL documents for your service. These documents provide essential information about your service’s contracts, endpoints, and data types. Clients can use this metadata to connect to and interact with your WCF service.
