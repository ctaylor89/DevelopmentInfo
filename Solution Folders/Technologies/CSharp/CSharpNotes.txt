Casting is the action of changing an entity of one data type into another.

It's little bit generic and it's somehow equivalent to a conversion because actually a cast is a conversion 
so the question should be when a cast (implicit or explicit) is allowed by the Language and when you have 
to use a (more) explicit conversion?

These below casts are implicit because during the conversion you won't lose any information (you just make the type wider). 
Vice versa implicit cast isn't allowed because, regardless their actual values (because they can be checked only at run-time), 
during conversion you may lose some information.

	int tinyInteger = 10;
	long bigInteger = tinyInteger;

	float tinyReal = 10.0f;
	double bigReal = tinyReal;

Explicit casts
A cast is explicit when the conversion isn't done implicitly by the compiler and then you must use the cast operator. Usually it means that:

You may lose information or data so you have to be aware of it.
Conversion may fail (because you can't convert one type to the other) so, again, you must be aware of what you're doing.

This code will compile but it may fail at run-time (it depends on the effective type of casted objects) with an InvalidCastException:

	object obj = GetNextObjectFromInput();
	string text = (string)obj;

	obj = GetNextObjectFromInput();
	Exception exception = (Exception)obj;

---------------------------------------------------------------
typeof takes a type name (which you specify at compile time).
GetType gets the runtime type of an instance.
It returns true if an instance is in the inheritance tree.
Example:
	class Animal { } 
	class Dog : Animal { }

	Dog spot = new Dog(); 
	PrintTypes(spot);

	void PrintTypes(Animal a) { 
		print(a.GetType() == typeof(Animal)) // false 
		print(a is Animal)                   // true 
		print(a.GetType() == typeof(Dog))    // true
	}

What about typeof(T)? Is it also resolved at compile time?
Yes. T is always what the type of the expression is. Remember, a generic method is basically a whole bunch of methods 
with the appropriate type. 
Example:
	string Foo<T>(T object) { return typeof(T).Name; }

	Animal probably_a_dog = new Dog();
	Dog    definitely_a_dog = new Dog();

	Foo(probably_a_dog);			// this calls Foo<Animal> and returns "Animal"
	Foo<Animal>(probably_a_dog);	// this is exactly the same as above
	Foo<Dog>(probably_a_dog);		// !!! This will not compile. The parameter expects a Dog, you cannot pass in an Animal.

	Foo(definitely_a_dog);			// this calls Foo<Dog> and returns "Dog"
	Foo<Dog>(definitely_a_dog);		// this is exactly the same as above.
	Foo<Animal>(definitely_a_dog);	// this calls Foo<Animal> and returns "Animal". 
	Foo((Animal)definitely_a_dog);	// this does the same as above, returns "Animal"

---------------------------------------------------------------
_Access_Levels

virtual: By default, methods are non-virtual. You cannot override a non-virtual method.
You cannot use the virtual modifier with the static, abstract, private, or override modifiers.
It is an error to use the virtual modifier on a static property.
A virtual inherited property can be overridden in a derived class by including a property declaration that 
uses the override modifier.

protected: A protected member is accessible within its class and by derived class instances. Using protected means you can have 
functionality in a class that's available to derived classes, but not to classes that just instantiate the base class.

internal: The internal keyword is an access modifier for types and type members. Internal types or members are accessible only 
within files in the same assembly.

protected internal: Access is limited to types derived from the containing class(protected) or the current assembly(internal).
Note that: protected internal means "protected OR internal" (any class in the same assembly, or any derived class - even if it 
is in a different assembly).

private protected: Access is limited to the containing class or types derived from the containing class within the current assembly. 
Available since C# 7.2.
---
Classes and structs that are declared directly within a namespace (that are not nested within other classes or structs) 
can be either public or internal. Internal is the default if no access modifier is specified.

The access level for class members and struct members, including nested classes and structs, is private by default.

Interfaces default to internal access.
---------------------------------------------------------------
_Arrays

var students = new string[] {"John", "Doe"};
string[] teachers = {"Peter", "John"};       int[] Requests = {22, 33, 44};
var parents = new[] {"Mary", "Martha"};
var grades = new int[0];

var students = studentList.ToArray(); // In situations where we are not sure of the number of elements, start with a list.

---------------------------------------------------------------
_Attributes

[Obsolete]
[Obsolete("Will cause a compiler error", true)]  // set to true will cause a compiler error
[Obsolete("Will cause a compiler Warning")]

The Conditional attribute is often used with the DEBUG identifier to enable trace and logging features for debug builds but not in 
release builds, like this:

	[Conditional("DEBUG")]
	public void DoSomething() { }

	public void Foo()
	{
		DoSomething(); //Code compiles and is cleaner, DoSomething always
					   //exists, however this is only called during DEBUG.
	}

#define TRACE_ON  [Conditional("TRACE_ON")]

If a method has multiple Conditional attributes, a call to the method is included if at least one of the conditional symbols is defined.
	[Conditional("A"), Conditional("B")]

[Serializable]

The following example sets the default value of MyProperty to false.
private bool myVal=false;

	[DefaultValue(false)]
	public bool MyProperty {
		get {
		   return myVal;
		}
		set {
		   myVal=value;
		}
	 }

This allows you to ignore (in any xml serialisation) 'parent' objects that would otherwise cause exceptions when saving.
[XmlIgnore]

[XmlRoot]

[XmlElement]

[XmlAttribute]

Being a middle tier developer I like

System.ComponentModel.EditorBrowsableAttribute Allows me to hide properties so that the UI developer is not overwhelmed with properties 
that they don't need to see.

System.ComponentModel.BindableAttribute Some things don't need to be databound. Again, lessens the work the UI developers need to do.
The only purpose of the BindableAttribute is to support the Visual Studio IDE (as does most attributes in ComponentModel namespace). 
It doesn't affect how your code executes at all. The purpose of it is the tell Visual Studio that the particular property supports 
Binding through the designer.

I use  System.STAThreadAttribute
      System.ThreadStaticAttribute when needed.

Off the top of my head, here is a quick list, roughly sorted by frequency of use, of predefined attributes I actually use in a big 
project (~500k LoCs):Flags, Serializable, WebMethod, COMVisible, TypeConverter, Conditional, ThreadStatic, Obsolete, 
InternalsVisibleTo, DebuggerStepThrough.
---
The [Flags] attribute should be used whenever the enumerable represents a collection of possible values, rather than a single value. 
Such collections are often used with bitwise operators. The [Flags] attribute enables a nice representation by the .ToString() method
to show multiple values by the value name:
    Ex: Using the flags attribute on an enum:
    enum Suits { Spades = 1, Clubs = 2, Diamonds = 4, Hearts = 8 }
    [Flags] enum SuitsWithFlags { Spades = 1, Clubs = 2, Diamonds = 4, Hearts = 8 }

    var str1 = (Suits.Spades | Suits.Diamonds).ToString();
               // "5"
    var str2 = (SuitsWithFlags.Spades | SuitsFlags.Diamonds).ToString();
               // "Spades, Diamonds"
---
For MVC [ActionName("Name")] allows you to have a Get action and Post action with the same method signature, or to use dashes in 
the action name, which otherwise would not be possible without creating a route for it.

Attaching the WebMethod attribute to a Public method indicates that you want the method exposed as part of the XML Web service. 
You can also use the properties of this attribute to further configure the behavior of the XML Web service method. You can 
optionally set cache duration and buffer response.
    [WebMethod]

On configuration sections
    [ConfigurationProperty] 

Indicates that the value of a static field is unique for each thread.
    [ThreadStatic] static double previous = 0.0;

In asp.net
    [NotifyParentProperty(true)]
---------------------------------------------------------------

Action objects return no values. The Action type is similar to a void method. It must never return a value onto the evaluation stack. 
This generic type is found in the System namespace.

Action<int> example1 = (int x) => Console.WriteLine("Write {0}", x);
Action<int, int> example2 = (x, y) => Console.WriteLine("Write {0} and {1}", x, y);
Action example3 = () => Console.WriteLine("Done");

// Call the anonymous methods with a number of arguments equal to the specific type of Action
example1.Invoke(1);
example2.Invoke(2, 3);
example3.Invoke();

Action<int> action = new Action<int>(Method1)

---------------------------------------------------------------
The Func type provides a way to store anonymous methods in a generalized and simple way.

// Create a Func instance that has one parameter and one return value.
// Parameter is an integer, result value is a string.
Func<int, string> func1 = (x) => string.Format("string = {0}", x);

// Func instance with two parameters and one result.
// Parameters bool and int, returns string.
Func<bool, int, string> func2 = (b, x) => string.Format("string = {0} and {1}", b, x);

// Func instance that has no parameters and one result value.
Func<double> func3 = () => Math.PI / 2;

// Call the Invoke instance method on the anonymous functions.
Console.WriteLine(func1.Invoke(5));
Console.WriteLine(func2.Invoke(true, 10));
Console.WriteLine(func3.Invoke());
---------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to examine an item in a generic list to determine whether it is valid or to compare it to some other item, 
the compiler must have some guarantee that the operator or method the compiler has to call will be supported by any type argument 
that might be specified by client code. This guarantee is obtained by applying one or more constraints to your generic 
class definition. 

// The type must be of Employee or a sub class of Employee. This allows the class to access members of the Employee class.
public class GenericList<T> where T : Employee
{...}

// In a generic list, multiple constraints can be applied to the same type parameter, and the constraints themselves can be generic 
types, as follows:
class EmployeeList<T> where T : Employee, IEmployee, System.IComparable<T>, new()
 
By constraining the type parameter, you increase the number of allowable operations and method calls to those supported by the 
constraining type and all types in its inheritance hierarchy. Therefore, when you design generic classes or methods, if you will be 
performing any operation on the generic members beyond simple assignment or calling any methods not supported by System.Object, you 
will have to apply constraints to the type parameter.

// You can apply constraints to multiple parameters, and multiple constraints to a single parameter, as shown in the following example:
class Base { }
class Test<T, U>
    where U : struct 
    where T : Base, new() {...}     //Ex: Multiple constraints to a single parameter

Constraint			Description
where T: struct		Type argument must be a value type. Any value type except Nullable can be specified.
where T : class		Type argument must be a reference type; this applies also to any class, interface, delegate, or array type.
where T : new()		Type argument must have a public parameterless constructor. When used together with other constraints, the 
					new() constraint must be specified last.
where T : <base class name>
 The type argument must be or derive from the specified base class.
where T : <interface name>
 The type argument must be or implement the specified interface. Multiple interface constraints can be specified. The constraining 
interface can also be generic.
where T : U
 The type argument supplied for T must be or derive from the argument supplied for U.

---------------------------------------------------------------
_Classes

C# abstract class explained
Abstraction in C# is the process to hide the internal details and show only the functionality. The abstract modifier indicates 
the incomplete implementation. 
An abstract class is a special type of class that cannot be instantiated. An abstract class is designed to be inherited by subclasses 
that either implement or override its methods. In other words, abstract classes are either partially implemented or not implemented 
at all. You can have functionality in your abstract class. The methods in an abstract class can be both abstract and concrete. An 
abstract class can have constructors and this is one major difference between an abstract class and an interface. You can't 
instantiate the abstract class itself but the derived class still has all the pieces of the base class. Its not only valid to do it, 
its one of the primary reasons why you would do it. You can take advantage of abstract classes to design components and specify some 
level of common functionality that must be implemented by derived classes.

Differences between an abstract class and an interface
An abstract class allows you to create functionality that subclasses can access or override. An interface only allows you to 
define functionality, not implement it. A class can extend only one abstract class, but it can take advantage of multiple 
interfaces.

public abstract class Animal 
{
    private string data;

    protected Animal(string myString){      *Note that the constructor is protected to limit it being called only by the sub class.
      data = myString;
    }

    public abstract void FeedIt();      

    public virtual void CombAnimal()        *This method does not need to be overriden.    
    {...}
}

public class B : A
{
    B(string myString) : base(myString){}

    public override void FeedIt()           * Mandatory to override the abstract method.
    {
        Console.WriteLine("class Geek1");
    }
}

A user must use the override keyword before the method is declared as abstract in the child class, the abstract class is used to 
inherit in the child class.
An abstract class cannot be inherited by structures.
An abstract class can contain constructors or destructors.
An abstract class can implement functions with non-Abstract methods.
An abstract class cannot support multiple inheritances.
An abstract class can’t be static.

If you have to implement an abstract method that you do not need, you can just over write it and throw new NonImplementedException();
---
A static class cannot be instantiated. You cannot use the new operator to create a variable of the class type. Because there is no 
instance variable, you access the members of a static class by using the class name itself. 

A static class is loaded by the .NET runtime when the program that references the class is loaded. The program cannot specify exactly 
when the class is loaded. However, it is guaranteed to be loaded and to have its fields initialized and its static constructor called 
before the class is referenced for the first time in your program. A static constructor is only called one time, and a static class 
remains in memory for the lifetime of the application domain in which your program resides.

The main features of a static class:
 Contains only static members, cannot be instantiated, is sealed, cannot contain Instance Constructors, constructor only called once.

_Dependency

http://tutorials.jenkov.com/ood/understanding-dependencies.html
Understanding dependencies is important when doing object oriented design of API's and applications. 
Whenever a class A uses another class or interface B, then A depends on B. A cannot carry out it's work without B, and A cannot 
be reused without also reusing B. In such a situation the class A is called the "dependant" and the class or interface B is called 
the "dependency". A dependant class depends on its dependencies.

Two classes that uses each other are called "coupled". The coupling between classes can be loose or tight, or somewhere in between. 
The tightness of a coupling is not binary. It is not either "loose" or "tight". The degrees of tightness are continuous, not discrete. 
You can also characterize dependencies as "strong" or "weak". A tight coupling leads to strong dependencies, and a loose coupling leads 
to weak dependencies, or even no dependencies in some situations.

Dependencies, or couplings, are directional. That A depends on B doesn't mean that B also depends on A.

_DisposePattern  Dispose Pattern

http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2756468&seqNum=7

The standard dispose pattern frees your unmanaged resources using the IDisposable interface when clients remember, and it uses the 
finalizer defensively when clients forget. Your class must have a finalizer if and only if it directly contains unmanaged resources.

The implementation of your IDisposable.Dispose() method is responsible for four tasks:
  Freeing all unmanaged resources.
  Freeing all managed resources that implement IDisposable (this includes unhooking events).
  Setting a state flag to indicate that the object has been disposed of. You may need to check this state and throw ObjectDisposed 
  exceptions in your public members if any get called after disposing of an object.

Suppressing finalization. You call GC.SuppressFinalize(this) to accomplish this task.
To begin, your class must have a finalizer if and only if it directly contains unmanaged resources. You should not rely on clients 
to always call the Dispose() method. In a managed environment, you do not need to write a finalizer for every type you create; you 
do it only for types that store unmanaged types or store types that contain members that implement IDisposable. 

Even if you need only the IDisposable interface, not a finalizer, implement the entire pattern. Otherwise, you limit your derived 
classes by complicating their implementation of the standard dispose idiom.

The Object class provides no implementation for the Finalize method, and the garbage collector does not mark types derived from 
Object for finalization unless they override the Finalize method.

When a finalizable object is discovered to be no longer used, its finalizer is put in a queue so that its cleanup actions are executed, 
but the object itself is promoted to the next generation. Therefore, you have to wait until the next garbage collection that occurs on 
that generation (which is not necessarily the next garbage collection) to determine whether the object has been reclaimed.

public class MyGarbage : IDisposable
{
    public String name = String.Empty;              // A managed type
    public SqlConnection con = null;                // An unmanaged type        
    private bool alreadyDisposed = false;           // Flag for already disposed
    
	public MyGarbage()
    {
        name = "This property (name) is managable resource";
        sqlConnection = new SqlConnection();
    }
    ~MyGarbage()					// Finalizer is called only by the GC
    {
        Dispose(false);             // False param indicates that object is being deleted by the GC. Dispose not being called by code.
    }
    
	protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {  
        if(alreadyDisposed)
            return;

        if (disposing)             // If Dispose() called by code and not GC
        {
            // Free managed resource here
            name = null;
        }
        
        // Free unmanaged resource here
        sqlConnection = null;
        Console.WriteLine("Unmanaged object has been disposed");
    }
 
    public void Dispose()           // This method will only be called from code
    {
        Dispose(true);						// Pass in true to free managed resources
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        if (alreadyDisposed)
            throw new ObjectDisposedException("MyGarbage", "Called Example Method on Disposed object");
        ...
    }
}
---
The public Dispose method is never automatically called by the CLR, it is only called explicitly by the owner of the object, 
which in some cases may be another framework, such as ASP.NET.
---
Managed objects are created, managed and under scope of CLR, pure .NET code is managed by the .Net runtime, Anything that lies 
within .NET scope and under .NET framework classes such as string, int, bool variables are referred to as managed code.

UnManaged objects are created outside the control of .NET libraries and are not managed by CLR, example of such unmanaged code is 
COM objects, file streams, connection objects, Interop objects. (Basically, third party libraries that are referred in .NET code.)
---------------------------------------------------------------
_Exceptions

In a UI app such as Winforms or WPF, a "cross thread exception" occurs if you are accessing UI components from a background thread.
---------------------------------------------------------------
_Expression

The simplest C# expressions are literals (for example, integer and real numbers) and names of variables. You can combine them into 
complex expressions by using operators. Typically, an expression produces a result and can be included in another expression. A 
void method call is an example of an expression that doesn't produce a result. It can be used only as a statement.

The actions that a program takes are expressed in statements. Common actions include declaring variables, assigning values, 
calling methods, looping through collections, and branching to one or another block of code, depending on a given condition. 

In the following code, examples of expressions are at the right-hand side of assignments:
    int a, b, c;
    a = 7;
    b = a;
    c = b++;
    b = a + b * c;
    c = a >= 100 ? b : c / 10;
    a = (int)Math.Sqrt(b * b + c * c);

    string s = "String literal";
    char l = s[s.Length - 1];

    var numbers = new List<int>(new[] { 1, 2, 3 });
    b = numbers.FindLast(n => n > 1);

Interpolated string expressions that provide convenient syntax to create formatted strings:
    var r = 2.3;
    var message = $"The area of a circle with radius {r} is {Math.PI * r * r:F3}.";

Lambda expressions that allow you to create anonymous functions(In this case the lambda expression is the parameter):
    int[] numbers = { 2, 3, 4, 5 };
    var maximumSquare = numbers.Max(x => x * x);  // Output = 25;

Query expressions that allow you to use query capabilities directly in C#:
    var scores = new[] { 90, 97, 78, 68, 85 };    
    IEnumerable<int> highScoresQuery =
        from score in scores
        where score > 80
        orderby score descending
        select score;
    Console.WriteLine(string.Join(" ", highScoresQuery));   // Output is: 97 90 85

An expression-bodied method consists of a single expression that returns a value whose type matches the method's return type, or, 
for methods that return void, that performs some operation. For example, types that override the ToString method typically include 
a single expression that returns the string representation of the current object.
    private string fname;
    private string lname;

    public override string ToString() => $"{fname} {lname}".Trim();
    public void DisplayName() => Console.WriteLine(ToString());    

The following code example demonstrates how to represent a lambda expression both as executable code in the form of a delegate and as data 
in the form of an expression tree. It also demonstrates how to turn the expression tree back into executable code by using the Compile method.

For example, AsQueryable() is used when an expression tree is to be constructed.

Conceptually, Expression<Func<T>> is completely different from Func<T>. Func<T> denotes a delegate which is pretty much a pointer to a method 
and Expression<Func<T>> denotes a tree data structure for a lambda expression. This tree structure describes what a lambda expression does 
rather than doing the actual thing.

// Lambda expression as executable code.
    Func<int, bool> deleg = i => i < 5;
// Invoke the delegate and display the output.
    Console.WriteLine("deleg(4) = {0}", deleg(4));

// Lambda expression as data in the form of an expression tree.
    System.Linq.Expressions.Expression<Func<int, bool>> expr = i => i < 5;
// Compile the expression tree into executable code.
    Func<int, bool> deleg2 = expr.Compile();
// Invoke the method and print the output.
    Console.WriteLine("deleg2(4) = {0}", deleg2(4));

/*  This code produces the following output:
    deleg(4) = True
    deleg2(4) = True
*/
---------------------------------------------------------------
_ExpressionBodied

// This creates a new YearMonth class passing the DateTime value to it's constructor, then accessing the Value property of the class.
public string DefaultValue => new YearMonth(DateTime.Now).Value;
---------------------------------------------------------------
_Interfaces

An interface contains definitions for a group of related functionalities that a non-abstract class or a struct must implement. An interface 
may define static methods(since C#8), which must have an implementation. Beginning with C# 8.0, an interface may define a default implementation for 
members. An interface may not declare instance data such as fields, auto-implemented properties, or property-like events.

By using interfaces, you can, for example, include behavior from multiple sources in a class. That capability is important in C# because 
the language doesn't support multiple inheritance of classes. In addition, you must use an interface if you want to simulate inheritance 
for structs, because structs can't actually inherit from another struct or class.

Interfaces can contain instance methods, properties, events, indexers, or any combination of those four member types. 
Interfaces may contain static constructors, fields, constants, or operators. 
Beginning with C# 11, interface members that aren't fields may be static abstract. 
An interface can't contain instance fields, instance constructors, or finalizers. 
Interface members are public by default, and you can explicitly specify accessibility modifiers, such as public, protected, internal, 
private, protected internal, or private protected. A private member must have a default implementation.

To implement an interface member, the corresponding member of the implementing class must be public, non-static, and have the same 
name and signature as the interface member.

A class or struct that implements an interface must provide an implementation for all declared members without a default implementation 
provided by the interface.

Properties and indexers of a class can define extra accessors for a property or indexer that's defined in an interface. For example, 
an interface might declare a property that has a get accessor. The class that implements the interface can declare the same property with 
both a get and set accessor. However, if the property or indexer uses explicit implementation, the accessors must match.
---
Explicit Interface Implementation Example

public IControl
{
    void paint();
}

public ISurface
{
    void paint();
}

public SampleClass : IControl, ISurface
{
    public void IControl.paint()                // Explicit implementation
    {
        Console.Writeline("This method implements IControl interface");
    }

    public void ISurface.paint()
    {
        Console.Writeline("This method implements ISurface interface");
    }
}

IControl cntrl = new SampleClass();
ISurface service = new SampleClass();
cntrl.paint();          // Will print line "This method implements IControl interface"
surface.paint();        // Will print line "This method implements ISurface interface"
---
If a class or struct implements two interfaces that contain a member with the same signature without an explict interface implementation, 
then implementing that member on the class will cause both interfaces to use that member as their implementation.
interface IControl
{
    void Paint();
}

interface ISurface
{
    void Paint();
}

class SampleClass : IControl, ISurface
{
    // Both ISurface.Paint and IControl.Paint call this method.  
    public void Paint()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Paint method in SampleClass");
    }
}

You can implement an interface member explicitly by creating a class member that is only called through the interface, and is specific 
to that interface. This is accomplished by naming the class member with the name of the interface and a period.

public class SampleClass : IControl, ISurface
{
    void IControl.Paint()
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine("IControl.Paint");
    }
    void ISurface.Paint()
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine("ISurface.Paint");
    }
}

// Call the Paint methods from Main.

SampleClass obj = new SampleClass();
//obj.Paint();  // Compiler error. Can only be called through an interface.

IControl c = (IControl)obj;
c.Paint();  // Calls IControl.Paint on SampleClass.

ISurface s = (ISurface)obj;
s.Paint(); // Calls ISurface.Paint on SampleClass.

_Keywords

const  Use the const keyword to declare a constant field or a constant local. Constant fields and locals aren't variables and may 
not be modified. Constants can be numbers, Boolean values, strings, or a null reference. The readonly keyword differs from the 
const keyword. A const field can only be initialized at the declaration of the field. A readonly field can be initialized either 
at the declaration or in a constructor(at runtime).
---
Properties are not variables and therefore cannot be passed as out parameters.
You can't use the in, ref, and out keywords for the following kinds of methods:
* Async methods, which you define by using the async modifier.
* Iterator methods, which include a yield return or yield break statement.

The out keyword causes arguments to be passed by reference. It makes the formal parameter an alias for the argument, which must 
be a variable. In other words, any operation on the parameter is made on the argument. It is like the ref keyword, except that 
ref requires the variable be initialized before it is passed. It is also like the 'in' keyword, except that 'in' does not allow 
the called method to modify the argument value. To use an out parameter, both the method definition and the calling method must 
explicitly use the out keyword. 

Variables passed as out arguments do not have to be initialized before being passed in a method call. However, the called method 
is required to assign a value before the method returns. The in, ref, and out keywords are not considered part of the method 
signature for the purpose of overload resolution. Therefore, methods cannot be overloaded if the only difference is 
that one method takes a ref or in argument and the other takes an out argument.

Extension methods have the following restrictions:
The out keyword cannot be used on the first argument of an extension method.
The ref keyword cannot be used on the first argument of an extension method when the argument is not a struct, or a generic type 
not constrained to be a struct.
The in keyword cannot be used unless the first argument is a struct. The in keyword cannot be used on any generic type, even when 
constrained to be a struct.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Directory and DirectoryInfo Class - Exposes static methods for creating, moving, and enumerating through directories and 
subdirectories. This class cannot be inherited.

Directory is a static class that provides static methods for working with directories. DirectoryInfo is an instance of a class that 
provides information about a specific directory. So for example if you wanted the information about C:\Temp:

var dirInfo = new DirectoryInfo("C:\\Temp");
if (dirInfo.Exists) {
    FileInfo[] files = dirInfo.GetFiles("*.*", SearchOption.AllDirectories);
    ...
}

If you just wanted the names as strings it might be quicker and easier to avoid creating an instance of DirectoryInfo by using the 
static methods of Directory.

if (Directory.Exists("C:\\Temp")) {
    string[] files = Directory.GetFiles("C:\\Temp", "*.*", SearchOption.AllDirectories);
    ...
}

If you are going to be making many calls to the FileSystem, especially when its the same folder or in subdirectory of said folder, 
MSDN suggests using DirectoryInfo.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Generally if you are performing a single operation on a file, use the File class. If you are performing multiple operations on the 
same file, use FileInfo.

The reason to do it this way is because of the security checking done when accessing a file. When you create an instance of FileInfo, 
the check is only performed once. However, each time you use a static File method the check is performed.

When using DirectoryInfo.Exists and FileInfo.Exists, they do not represent the current state, only the state at the time the info 
objects were created. You may need to call Refresh() to get the current state.
---------------------------------------------------------------

This is what System.IO.Path.Combine(string, string) does for you:

It validates both paths. They can be null or empty, but if they contain invalid path chars, an argument exception is thrown.
It uses Path.DirectorySeparatorChar to combine, but will never end up having two separators or none.
It takes only the second path if it is absolute, so you never get paths like "c:\data\d:\data\logs\myfile.xml"
If one of the paths is null or empty, the other one is returned.
Simple combinations
If the second path is relative, it will get combined with the first path.

Path.Combine("abc", "file.xml") => "abc\file.xml"
Path.Combine("abc\", "file.xml") => "abc\file.xml"
Path.Combine("c:\abc\", "file.xml") => "c:\abc\file.xml"
Path.Combine("c:\abc\", "data\file.xml") => "c:\abc\data\file.xml"
Path.Combine("", "data\file.xml") => "data\file.xml"
Path.Combine("c:\abc", "") => "c:\abc"
Absolute second path
If the second path is absolute, the first one will be ignored. (See also Path.IsPathRooted(string))

Path.Combine("c:\abc", "\file.xml") => "\file.xml"

(if the second path starts with the DirectorySeparatorChar it is also treated as absolute!)
Path.Combine("c:\abc", "c:\file.xml") => "c:\file.xml"

A Stopwatch instance calculates and retains the cumulative elapsed time across multiple time intervals, until the instance 
is reset. Use Stop to stop the current interval measurement and retain the cumulative elapsed time value. Use Reset to stop 
any interval measurement in progress and clear the elapsed time value.

Use the Stopwatch.Restart Method to stops time interval measurement, resets the elapsed time to zero, and starts measuring elapsed time.

Stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds Property is a read-only long integer representing the total number of milliseconds measured by the current 
instance. You can query the properties Elapsed, ElapsedMilliseconds, and ElapsedTicks while the Stopwatch instance is running or stopped. 
The elapsed time properties steadily increase while the Stopwatch is running; they remain constant when the instance is stopped.

By default, the elapsed time value of a Stopwatch instance equals the total of all measured time intervals. Each call to Start begins 
counting at the cumulative elapsed time; each call to Stop ends the current interval measurement and freezes the cumulative elapsed time 
value. Use the Reset method to clear the cumulative elapsed time in an existing Stopwatch instance.


The Stopwatch.Start Method starts, or resumes, measuring elapsed time for an interval.

Timers allow you to control the execution of your application by being able to define when an action takes place.

	public static void Main()
	{
		System.Timers.Timer aTimer = new System.Timers.Timer();
		aTimer.Elapsed+=new ElapsedEventHandler(OnTimedEvent);
		aTimer.Interval=5000;
		aTimer.Enabled=true;

		Console.WriteLine("Press \'q\' to quit the sample.");
		while(Console.Read()!='q');
	}

	 // Specify what you want to happen when the Elapsed event is raised.
	 private static void OnTimedEvent(object source, ElapsedEventArgs e)
	 {
		 Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
	 }

 ---
If you're developing Windows.Forms application, use the System.Windows.Forms.Timer class. The benefit of this is that it runs on a 
UI thread, so it's simple to just define it and subscribe to its Tick event.
---------------------------------------------------------------
The ?? operator is called the null-coalescing operator. It returns the left-hand operand if the operand 
is not null; otherwise it returns the right hand operand.

// If x is null set y to -1. 
int y = x ?? -1;

// Assign i to return value of the method if the method's result is NOT null; otherwise, if the result 
// is null, set i to the default value of int. 
int i = GetMyNullableInt() ?? default(int);

// Display the value of s if s is NOT null; otherwise,  
// display the string "Unspecified".
string s = GetStringValue();
Console.WriteLine(s ?? "Unspecified");
---------------------------------------------------------------
The null conditional operator

// Call MethodA if someObject is not null. Return null to bar if someObject is null.
string bar = someObject?.MethodA();

long? length = someOject?.Length;
---------------------------------------------------------------
// Without the suffix m, the number is treated as a double and generates a compiler error.
decimal myMoney = 300.5m;

// There is no implicit conversion between floating-point types and the decimal types in either direction.
// A cast must be used to convert between these two types. For example:
decimal myMoney = 99.9m;
double x = (double)myMoney;
myMoney = (decimal)x;

---------------------------------------------------------------
_RandomNotes

Automatic memory management is only a small part of what makes a language managed. The most important distinction is that native code will 
compile to a binary executable, and managed code will compile to byte code that must be interpreted at runtime by a Just In Time compiler.

Native code's memory is not "managed", as in, memory isn't freed for you (Ex: C++'s delete), no reference counting, 
no garbage collection. Managed code is code whose memory is free and allocated for you, garbage collection and other goodies.

Mixed code is when you have managed code that calls onto an unmanaged layer. Normally, when you access a pure unmanaged C++ DLL from
managed code you call it from .NET using P/invoke.
---
P/Invoke is a technology that allows you to access structs, callbacks and functions in unmanaged libraries from your managed code. 
Most of the P/Invoke API is contained in two namespaces: System and System.Runtime.InteropServices. Using these two namespaces gives 
you the tools to describe how you want to communicate with the native component. 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke
---
Value types hold a value and are stored on the stack. Reference types hold a reference to where the value is located on the managed heap.
DateTime is a value type - a structure. With value types, when you do something like: DateTime a2 = a1;
a2 gets a copy of the values of a1. It is not the same reference to the same memory location, but a complete, separate copy.

On the other hand, Person is a reference type - a class. When you do: Person p2 = p1;
With a reference type, the reference that p2 points to is the same one that p1 points to. So changes in one are changes to both.

// Shallow and Deep copy example
public class IdInfo
{
    public int IdNumber;
    public IdInfo(int IdNumber)
    {
        this.IdNumber = IdNumber;
    }
}

public class Person
{
    public int Age;
    public string Name;                                 // A ref type variable
    public IdInfo IdInfo;								// A ref type variable

    public Person ShallowCopy()
    {
       return (Person) this.MemberwiseClone();			// Creates an independent copy except for the ref type variable - IDInfo
    }

    public Person DeepCopy()
    {
       Person other = (Person) this.MemberwiseClone();	// Creates an independent copy except for the ref type variable
       other.IdInfo = new IdInfo(IdInfo.IdNumber);		// Create a new instance of the ref type variable
       other.Name = String.Copy(Name);					// Copies same data but is a different object reference
       return other;
    }
}

* Note that copying manually performs faster than using MemberwiseClone().

MemberwiseClone() creates a new object and then copies the value type fields of the current object to the new object. But when 
there are reference type fields, the reference value is copied so that the clone will refer to the original referenced object.
---
A field is a member of a class or an object. A field can be of static or instance type.
Local variables are declared within a method or a specific block of statements.
---
Use null-coalescing assignment operator ??= to assign the value of right-hand side operand to left-hand side operand only if the 
left-hand side operand evaluates to null.

List<int> numbers = null;  
int? a = null;  
  
(numbers ??= new List<int>()).Add(5);  
Console.WriteLine(string.Join(" ", numbers));   // output: 5  
  
numbers.Add(a ??= 0);  
Console.WriteLine(string.Join(" ", numbers));   // output: 5 0  
Console.WriteLine(a);                           // output: 0 
---------------------------------------------------------------
_String_Methods

Clone
When you clone a string, the new string will have the same characters but have it's own instance.
it is simply another view of the same data. 

string s1 = "GeeksForgeeks";  
// Without explicit conversion you get error "Cannot implicitly convert type object to the string".
string s2 = (String)s1.Clone();  



CompareOrdinal
Compares two String objects by evaluating the numeric values of the corresponding Char objects in each string.
-----
Copy
The Copy method returns a String object that has the same value as the original string but represents a different object reference. It 
differs from an assignment operation, which assigns an existing string reference to an additional object variable. 
str2 = String.Copy(str1);
-----
CopyTo
Copies a specified number of characters from a specified position in this instance to a specified position in an -ARRAY- of Unicode characters.
-----
Contains
Returns a booleon value indicating whether a specified substring occurs within this string. Performs an ordinal 
(case-sensitive and culture-insensitive) comparison. int result = String.CompareOrdinal(str1, str2);
-----

EndsWith
EndsWith(String)
-----
Substring
// Get first three characters.
string sub = input.Substring(0, 3)    Returns substring of first 3 chars.
string sub = input.Substring(3, 3)    Returns substring of 3 chars starting at index 3.
string sub = input.Substring(6)       Returns substring of all chars after first 6.
-----
Equals
Determines whether two String objects have the same value. Performs an ordinal (case-sensitive and culture-insensitive) comparison.
Equals(String)
Equals(String, String) // Static method
-----
Format
Converts the value of objects to strings based on the formats specified and inserts them into another string.
-----
LastIndexOfAny searches for an array of strings. There are nine versions of the LastIndexOf method on the string type. 
They have different implementations. It returns -1 if no string is found.
-----
LastIndexOf
LastIndexOf searches strings from the right. It finds the location of the last occurrence of a letter or substring. 
int index1 = value.LastIndexOf('N');
int index2 = value.LastIndexOf("Perls");
int index4 = value.LastIndexOf("PERL", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
-----
IndexOf 
Returns the first index of a letter in a string. It can also find a substring. It returns negative one when nothing is found.
We often use IndexOf in loops. We keep track of several values at once to prevent us from searching the same parts over and over again.

Often strings have leading characters that we know cannot contain the searched-for value. We can skip these chars. This will give 
a performance boost because less searching is needed.

// Skip the first character with a startIndex of 1.
int comma = value.IndexOf(',', 1);
-----
LastIndexOfAny searches for multiple characters in reverse. It returns the final position of any of a set of characters.
// Search for last of any of these characters.
int index = value.LastIndexOfAny(new char[] { 'd', 'b' });

The performance of LastIndexOfAny is not ideal. If you want to improve it, one thing you can do is store the character array argument 
in a field—static or instance—and then use a reference to that cache as the argument. This will avoid an object creation on every call. 
And reducing object creations reduces memory pressure and garbage collections.
-----
StartsWith
Determines whether the beginning of this string instance matches a specified string.

Split
Splits a string into substrings that are based on the characters in an array. Called on a string instance.
Split(Char[])   Split(Char[], StringSplitOptions)
---------------------------------------------------------------
_JSON

// Example
{
  "id": "110355660738", 
  "picture": {
    "data": {
      "url": "https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-prn2/1027085_12033235063_5234302342947_n.jpg", 
      "is_silhouette": false
    }
  }
}

// To read the field "url" use dynamic (using Json.Net)
dynamic obj = JObject.Parse(json);
Console.WriteLine((string)obj.picture.data.url);
---------------------------------------------------------------
_Loops
Using a foreach loop demonstrates to anyone using your code that you are planning to do something to each member of a collection 
irrespective of its place in the collection. It also shows you aren't modifying the original collection (and throws an exception 
if you try to).

The other advantage of foreach is that it works on any IEnumerable, where as for only makes sense for IList, where each element 
actually has an index. However, if you need to use the index of an element, then of course you should be allowed to use a for 
loop. But if you don't need to use an index, having one is just cluttering your code.

IEnumerable methods

---------------------------------------------------------------
_MethodImplOptions
This enumeration has a FlagsAttribute attribute that allows a bitwise combination of its member values.

AggressiveInlining	The method should be inlined if possible.
ForwardRef      The method is declared, but its implementation is provided elsewhere.
InternalCall    The call is internal, that is, it calls a method that is implemented within the common language runtime.
NoInlining	    The method cannot be inlined. Inlining is an optimization by which a method call is replaced with the method body.
NoOptimization	The method is not optimized by the just-in-time (JIT) compiler or by native code generation (see ) when debugging 
                possible code generation problems.
PreserveSig	    The method signature is exported exactly as declared.
Synchronized    The method can be executed by only one thread at a time.
Unmanaged       The method is implemented in unmanaged code.

[MethodImplAttribute(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)] 
public static string GetCalendarName(Calendar cal)
{
    return cal.ToString().Replace("System.Globalization.", "").Replace("Calendar", "");
}

_Properties

Good article to read  03/2020
https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/understanding-properties-in-C-Sharp/

// Auto-implemented properties. When no additional calculation is needed. 
public string Name { get; set; }

// Initialization of a property    
public double AuthorCount {  
    get;  
    private set;  
} = 99;  

public class MyClass
{
    private string member1;
    public string Member1 { get => member1; set => member1 = value; }
}

// This is a property get accessor with an Expression Body Definition, as introduced in C# 7. 
// It is just syntactic sugar equivalent to get { return member1; }.
get => member1 

// This is a property set accessor with an Expression Body Definition. This syntax was introduced for setters in C# 7. 
// It is syntactic sugar for set { member1 = value; }
set => member1 = value; 
---------------------------------------------------------------
List Extension methods

// Using the LINQ Extension method on a list class
List<string> dayValues = new List<string>()  { "4", "7", "3", "8", "2", "5" };
int total = dayValues.Sum(x => Convert.ToInt32(x));
----
// Declare two collections of int elements.
int[] array1 = { 1, 3, 5, 7 };
List<int> list1 = new List<int>() { 1, 3, 5, 7 };

// Use Sum extension on their elements.
int sum1 = array1.Sum();
int sum2 = list1.Sum();
----
There are drawbacks associated with the Sum extension method. The Sum method has some overhead that will make it slower than a simple 
for-loop in the C# language. It inserts a null check at the start of its method body. Also it uses a foreach-loop, which can produce 
slower execution on value types.

By using Sum, you avoid copying code into your program source and instead exploit code inside the Framework that is more tested. This 
will reduce the assembly's code size and number of lines of C# code. This could be preferable.

It provides a way for you to write less code that requires less thought to maintain, at the price of runtime performance.

List<T> has a GetEnumerator() method, separate from its implementation of IEnumerable<T>, which returns a mutable structure 
type List<T>.Enumerator. In most contexts, that type will yield slightly better performance than would a standalone heap object. 
Compilers which duck-type enumerators (as both C# and vb.net do) can take advantage of this when generating foreach code. If the List<T> 
is cast to IEnumrable<T> before the foreach, the IEnumerable<T>.GetEnumerator() method will return a heap-allocated object, rendering 
the optimization impossible.
----
The First extention method locates the first matching object. We access the First extension method in the System.Linq namespace. The 
argument to First is a Predicate instance and it can be specified in the lambda syntax. The predicate instance is run until an instance 
returns true.

customers.First(x => x.ID == 5);  or  customers.First(new Func<Customer, bool>((Customer x) => x.ID == 5));

FirstOrDefault is almost the same as First. The difference is how it handles empty collections. If a collection is empty, it returns 
the default value for the type.

	var list = new List<string>() { "Cat", "Rat", "Mouse" };
	Console.WriteLine(list.FirstOrDefault());

	// This query produces no results so FirstOrDefault is null.
	var query1 = from element in list
		    where element.Length > 10
		    select element;
	Console.WriteLine(query1.FirstOrDefault() == null);

	// This query produces one result, so FirstOrDefault returns a string.
	var query2 = from element in list
		     where element.Length > 3
		     select element;
	Console.WriteLine(query2.FirstOrDefault());

	// This array has no elements, so FirstOrDefault is zero.
	int[] array = new int[0];
	Console.WriteLine(array.FirstOrDefault());
    }
}
