Querying an XDocument vs. Querying an XElement

When you load a document via XDocument.Load, you will notice that you have to write queries slightly differently than when you load via XElement.Load.

When you load an XML document into an XElement via XElement.Load, the XElement at the root of the XML tree contains the root element of the loaded 
document. 

When you load the same XML document into an XDocument via XDocument.Load, the root of the tree is an XDocument node, and the root 
element of the loaded document is the one allowed child XElement node of the XDocument. The LINQ to XML axes operate relative to the root node.
