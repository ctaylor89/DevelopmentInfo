No fluff — these are the ones that actually show up in job postings and client scopes:

Accounts Payable (A/P) – Entering, coding, and paying bills

Accounts Receivable (A/R) – Invoicing, posting payments, collections

Bank Reconciliation – Matching bank/credit card statements to books

Month-End Close – Closing books on a monthly schedule

Financial Statements – Preparing P&L, balance sheet, cash flow

If you want to optimize for hiring platforms

Temp / contract roles lean heavily on: reconciliations, clean-up, month-end close, A/P, A/R

Remote roles often emphasize: QuickBooks, reconciliations, invoicing, payroll support

Higher-paying gigs include: month-end close, financial statements, sales tax, audit support

If you want, I can tailor this list for resume keywords, LinkedIn searches, or Upwork/FlexJobs listings — different platforms reward different wording.
