Common_Bookkeeping_Keywords

Here are the 20 most common, high-signal keywords you’ll see in bookkeeping task descriptions. 
These are the ones that actually show up in job postings and client scopes:

Accounts Payable (A/P) – Entering, coding, and paying bills
Accounts Payable (A/P) is the function that tracks and manages a business’s short-term obligations to vendors for goods and 
services already received but not yet paid. It includes receiving and reviewing vendor invoices, verifying accuracy and 
approval, coding expenses to the correct general ledger accounts, and scheduling payments according to agreed terms to maintain 
cash flow and avoid late fees. A/P also involves reconciling vendor statements, handling credits or disputes, and ensuring 
payments are issued correctly by check, ACH, or credit card. Done right, accounts payable keeps expenses accurate, supports clean 
financial reporting, and protects vendor relationships while giving management a clear picture of what the company owes and when.

* Note: ACH stands for Automated Clearing House. It’s an electronic bank-to-bank payment network used in the United States to move 
money securely and efficiently without paper checks or card processing. In accounts payable, ACH is used to pay vendors directly 
from the company’s bank account to the vendor’s bank account, usually in one to two business days.

The purpose of ACH payments is to reduce cost, speed up payments, and improve accuracy compared to checks. ACH payments are cheaper 
than credit cards, more reliable than mailing checks, and easier to track and reconcile in the accounting system. For businesses, 
ACH helps automate payments, improve cash flow control, and reduce the risk of lost or delayed payments.

Accounts Receivable (A/R) – Invoicing, posting payments, collections
Accounts Receivable covers the money that is owed to the business by customers for products or services already delivered. This 
includes creating and sending invoices, applying customer payments, tracking outstanding balances, and following up on overdue 
accounts. Accurate A/R ensures revenue is recorded correctly and cash is collected on time, which is critical for maintaining 
healthy cash flow.
* Note: Invoicing is creating and sending invoices. Invoicing is sometimes listed as a separate task from A/R, but it’s often 
bundled together since invoicing is the first step in the A/R process.
---
Bank Reconciliation – Matching bank/credit card statements to books
Bank reconciliation is the process of matching transactions in the accounting system to those shown on bank and credit card 
statements. The goal is to identify and resolve discrepancies such as missing entries, timing differences, bank fees, or errors. 
Regular bank reconciliations ensure cash balances are accurate and help catch fraud or mistakes early.
---
General Ledger (GL) – Maintaining and reviewing ledger accounts
The General Ledger is the core record that contains all financial transactions categorized into accounts such as cash, revenue, 
expenses, assets, and liabilities. Maintaining the General Ledger involves ensuring transactions are posted to the correct 
accounts and periods. A clean, accurate GL is essential because all financial reports are generated from it.

All standard financial reports are generated from the General Ledger (GL), either directly or indirectly. The GL is the system 
of record. Every transaction ends up there—sales, expenses, payroll, adjustments. Financial statements like the Profit & Loss, 
Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement are simply different ways of summarizing and organizing GL account balances for a given period.

The only nuance is the cash flow statement: it’s often derived using GL data plus logic (classifying cash vs non-cash activity), 
but it still depends entirely on what’s in the GL. If the GL is wrong or incomplete, every report built on top of it is wrong.

When we say “the General Ledger (GL) is the system of record,” we mean it is the authoritative, final source of truth for a 
company’s financial data. Every financial transaction, no matter where it starts (bank feed, invoice, payroll system, credit card, 
or sub-ledger like A/R or A/P)—must ultimately be posted to the GL. Once it’s in the GL, that entry is what the business officially 
recognizes for accounting and reporting purposes.

In practice, financial statements, audits, tax filings, and management reports all rely on the GL, not on raw bank statements or 
operational systems. If there’s a conflict between a bank feed, an invoice list, or a spreadsheet and what’s in the GL, the GL is 
what accountants, auditors, and regulators treat as correct. That’s why controlling, reconciling, and reviewing the GL is such a 
core responsibility in accounting: it’s the single place where all financial activity is finalized, validated, and preserved.
---
Journal Entries – Recording adjustments, accruals, corrections
Journal entries are manual or automated adjustments made to the accounting system to record transactions not captured through normal 
processes. Common examples include accruals, depreciation, corrections, and reclassifications. Proper journal entries ensure 
financial statements reflect the true financial position of the business.

*Note: An accrual is a journal entry used to record revenue or expenses in the period they are earned or incurred, even though no 
cash has changed hands yet. The purpose is to follow the accrual basis of accounting, which matches financial activity to the 
correct accounting period so financial statements reflect economic reality, not just cash movement. Accruals are typically recorded 
at month-end or year-end to capture items that belong in that period but haven’t been invoiced, billed, or paid.

In practice, an accrual usually creates a temporary balance sheet account—either an accrued liability (for expenses) or an accrued 
asset (for revenue). For example, if employees worked the last week of the month but won’t be paid until the next month, you accrue 
wages expense and record a liability for wages payable in your journal. When the actual bill or payment occurs later, the accrual 
is reversed or cleared so the expense or revenue isn’t double-counted. Accruals are critical for accurate profit measurement, 
clean period-end closes, and reliable financial reporting.
---
Month-End Close – Closing books on a monthly schedule
Month-end close is the structured process of finalizing the books for a completed month. It includes posting all transactions, 
reconciling accounts, reviewing balances, and generating financial statements. A timely and consistent close allows management to 
rely on accurate monthly financial data for decision-making.

Month-end close does include updating the General Ledger (GL). Here’s what that actually means in practice: during month-end close, 
all remaining transactions for the month are posted to the GL, including accruals, corrections, reclassifications, and recurring 
journal entries. Reconciliations are reviewed and any discrepancies are fixed in the GL, not in side spreadsheets. The goal is that, 
when the close is finished, the GL fully and accurately reflects the company’s financial activity for that month.

Once the GL is updated and reviewed, it’s effectively “locked” for that period (formally or informally), and financial statements 
are generated from it.
---
Financial Statements – Preparing P&L, balance sheet, cash flow
Financial statements are formal reports that summarize a company’s financial performance and position. The primary statements 
include the Profit and Loss (income statement), Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement. Bookkeepers are responsible for ensuring 
the underlying data is accurate so these reports can be trusted by management, lenders, and accountants.

All standard financial reports are generated from the General Ledger.

Invoicing / Billing – Creating and managing customer invoices
Invoicing involves creating and issuing bills to customers for goods or services provided. This includes ensuring correct pricing, 
taxes, payment terms, and customer information. Accurate and timely invoicing directly affects how quickly a business gets paid 
and how revenue is recognized.
---
Payroll Processing – Running payroll, deductions, filings support
Payroll processing covers calculating employee wages, deductions, taxes, and net pay, as well as issuing payments and maintaining 
payroll records. While payroll services may handle filings, bookkeepers often review payroll reports and post payroll entries 
correctly. Accurate payroll ensures compliance and proper expense reporting.
---
Expense Tracking – Categorizing and monitoring expenses
Expense tracking is the process of recording, categorizing, and monitoring business expenses. This includes operational costs, 
reimbursements, subscriptions, and credit card charges. Proper expense tracking supports budgeting, tax deductions, and accurate 
profitability analysis.
---
Budgeting – Tracking actuals vs budget (often light analysis)
Budgeting involves comparing actual financial results against planned expectations. Bookkeepers may assist by organizing historical 
data, tracking variances, and producing reports that show where spending differs from the budget. This helps management control 
costs and plan future spending.
---
Cash Flow Management – Monitoring inflows/outflows and balances
Cash flow management focuses on monitoring how money moves in and out of the business. It includes tracking inflows from customers, 
outflows for expenses, and timing differences between them. Effective cash flow management ensures the business can meet its 
obligations and avoid cash shortages.
---
Data Entry – Entering transactions accurately and on time
Data entry refers to recording financial transactions into the accounting system accurately and consistently. This includes sales, 
expenses, payments, and adjustments. Data entry errors flow directly into reports and reconciliations.
---
Account Reconciliations – Reconciling GL, AR, AP, and sub-ledgers
Account reconciliations involve comparing internal account balances to external records or supporting schedules. This can 
include bank accounts, credit cards, loans, and clearing accounts. Reconciliations verify accuracy and ensure balances are 
complete and supported.

* A transaction is cleared when:
	The bank or credit card has processed it.
	It appears on the statement.
	You’ve checked it off during reconciliation.
When you reconcile: 
	You compare QuickBooks to the statement
	You check off each transaction that appears
	QuickBooks marks it with a “C” (Cleared)
---
1099 Preparation – Tracking vendors and preparing 1099s
1099 preparation involves tracking payments made to independent contractors and preparing required year-end tax forms. Bookkeepers ensure vendors are classified correctly and totals are accurate. Proper 1099 handling helps the business stay compliant with IRS reporting requirements.
---
Sales Tax Compliance – Calculating, filing, and remitting sales tax
Sales tax compliance includes calculating, tracking, and reporting sales tax collected from customers. This may involve multiple states or jurisdictions with different rules. Accurate sales tax handling prevents penalties and ensures liabilities are recorded correctly.
---
Audit Support – Providing documentation and reports
Audit support means providing documentation, reports, and explanations to accountants or auditors. This includes transaction detail, reconciliations, and financial statements. Strong bookkeeping makes audits smoother and faster by reducing questions and corrections.
---
Financial Reporting – Custom or standard management reports
Financial reporting goes beyond standard statements to include customized reports for management. This may include department summaries, trend analysis, or KPI reports. Bookkeepers ensure reports are accurate, timely, and clearly presented.
---
Fixed Assets – Tracking assets and depreciation
Fixed assets are long-term purchases such as equipment, vehicles, and furniture. Bookkeeping tasks include recording acquisitions, tracking asset values, and posting depreciation. Proper fixed asset tracking ensures expenses are matched to the correct periods.
---
Clean-Up / Catch-Up Bookkeeping – Fixing messy or outdated books
Clean-up or catch-up bookkeeping involves correcting errors or bringing books up to date after a period of neglect. This may include reclassifying transactions, reconciling accounts, and fixing prior reporting issues. These projects restore financial accuracy and reliability.

* If you want to optimize for hiring platforms
Temp / contract roles lean heavily on: reconciliations, clean-up, month-end close, A/P, A/R
Remote roles often emphasize: QuickBooks, reconciliations, invoicing, payroll support.

Note: Payroll support means assisting with payroll-related tasks without being the person legally responsible for running payroll or filing payroll taxes. In remote bookkeeping roles, the bookkeeper typically supports a payroll service (like ADP, Gusto, Paychex, or QuickBooks Payroll) rather than replacing it. The work is operational and review-focused, not compliance-heavy.

Concretely, payroll support usually includes collecting and validating payroll inputs (hours worked, PTO, bonuses, commissions), reviewing payroll reports for accuracy before or after payroll runs, and posting payroll journal entries to the general ledger so wages, taxes, and benefits hit the correct accounts and periods. It also often involves reconciling payroll clearing accounts, tracking employer taxes and benefit expenses, and answering basic payroll-related questions from management (not employees).
Payroll support does not usually include in remote bookkeeping roles: filing payroll tax returns, making tax payments, handling garnishments, or resolving IRS/state notices. Those functions typically stay with the payroll provider or an accountant. When a job posting says “payroll support,” it’s signaling “hands-on bookkeeping around payroll” rather than “you own payroll compliance.”

* Higher-paying gigs include: month-end close, financial statements, sales tax, audit support

If you want, I can tailor this list for resume keywords, LinkedIn searches, or Upwork/FlexJobs listings — different 
platforms reward different wording.

Clean-Up / Catch-Up Bookkeeping
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Random_Notes
- Focus on accuracy and completeness
- Prioritize high-impact areas (e.g., reconciliations, financial statements)
- Communicate with stakeholders about progress and challenges
- Document all changes made during the clean-up process
- Establish a plan for ongoing maintenance and review
---
When paying vendors via ACH, ensure that you have the correct bank account details (account number, routing number) and authorization 
to debit your account. Double-check these details to avoid payment errors. Get a vendor's ACH authorization form if possible.
Get a vendor's W-9 form to have their taxpayer identification information on file before issuing payments. You 'll need this for year-end 1099 reporting.
---
After completing a bank reconciliation, document any discrepancies found and the actions taken to resolve them. This documentation is useful for future 
reference and audits. Check the balance per books against the balance per bank statement after adjustments to ensure they match.
Check the cut-off dates for transactions to ensure that all items are recorded in the correct accounting period during bank reconciliation.
Check for any outstanding checks or deposits in transit that may affect the reconciliation.
check for bank fees, interest income, or other adjustments that need to be recorded in the books.
After completing a bank reconciliation check the balance sheet for anything that looks off.
---
The balance sheet should always balance: Assets = Liabilities + Equity. If it doesn't, investigate discrepancies in account balances.
The balance sheet provides a snapshot of the company's financial position at a specific point in time, showing what the company 
owns (assets), owes (liabilities), and the owner's interest (equity).
---
When maintaining the General Ledger, regularly review account balances for unusual or unexpected entries that may indicate errors or fraud.
---
When preparing financial statements, ensure that all necessary adjustments (accruals, deferrals, depreciation) have been made to 
reflect the true financial position of the business.
---
When tracking fixed assets, maintain a detailed asset register that includes purchase date, cost, useful life, and depreciation 
method for each asset.
---
When performing month-end close, create a checklist of all tasks to be completed to ensure nothing is overlooked. This may 
include posting journal entries, preparing financial statements, and completing account reconciliations.
---
When managing accounts payable, prioritize payments based on due dates and any early payment discounts offered by vendors.
---
When managing accounts receivable, follow up promptly on overdue invoices to maintain healthy cash flow.
---
When processing payroll, ensure that all employee information (hours worked, deductions, tax withholdings) is accurate before
submitting payroll.
---
When tracking expenses, categorize them consistently to facilitate accurate reporting and analysis.
---
When supporting audits, organize documentation and reports in a clear and accessible manner to facilitate the audit process.
- Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards throughout all bookkeeping tasks.
---
When preparing for 1099 filings, review vendor payments to ensure that all required information is accurate and complete.
---
When managing sales tax compliance, stay informed about changes in tax rates and regulations in the jurisdictions where the company operates.
---
When reconciling a Credit Card account, what do you compare the bank feed to?
- Compare the bank feed to the credit card statement, not the bank feed to the bank statement, to ensure all transactions are 
accounted for and to identify any discrepancies. This helps verify that all charges, payments, and fees are accurately recorded 
in the accounting system(QB).

What you are reconciling (and what you are not) when reconciling a Credit Card account:
You ARE reconciling:
	QuickBooks credit card register
	Credit card statement ending balance
	Statement closing date

You are NOT reconciling:
	The bank feed
	Today’s online balance
	Pending/authorized charges

The bank feed is just a data entry helper. Reconciliation is an accounting control.

Why the bank feed is the wrong comparison
Credit cards are messy in real time:
	Pending charges
	Tips posting days later
	Returns posting separately
	Payments clearing on different dates

If you try to reconcile to the live feed,you will chase differences forever
	You’ll force transactions just to “make it work”
	Your books will be wrong
Statements are final. Feeds are not.
--
The correct Credit card account reconciliation comparison
During reconciliation, you compare:
Item					Source
Ending					balance	Credit card statement
Ending date				Statement closing date
Cleared transactions	Statement line items

QuickBooks checks off:
	Charges, Credits, Payments
	that appear on the statement, not what shows online today.

What the bank feed is good for
Use it to:
	Match existing charges
	Add missing transactions
	Catch fraud or missed entries
Then stop.

Reconciliation comes after data entry is clean.
--
Bottom line
	Statement = source of truth
	Feed = data entry assistant
	Reconciliation = confirmation, not correction

What “payee” actually means in QuickBooks

A payee is:

A vendor (money going out)

A customer (money coming in)

Or sometimes an employee or owner

It is not:

The bank

The account

The category

The payee is the counterparty in the transaction.

Why transactions show “without payees”

Bank feeds usually provide:

Amount

Date

Memo/description text

They often do NOT provide a clean vendor name that QuickBooks can map automatically.

So QuickBooks says:

“I have a transaction, but I don’t know who it’s with.”

Why payees matter (and why you shouldn’t ignore this)
	Payees affect:
	Vendor reports
	Expense detail
	1099 tracking
	Search and audit trails

Categories affect financials. Payees affect clarity. Both matter.
Leaving payees blank doesn’t usually break the Balance Sheet — but it kills reporting quality.

Best practice (real-world)
Assign payees for:

Regular vendors

Large expenses

Anything 1099-related

Don’t obsess over payees for:

Small one-off charges

Bank fees

Interest

Accuracy > perfection.

One important warning

Do not confuse “payee” with “category.”

Payee = who

Category = where it hits the books

You can have:

Correct category

Wrong or missing payee
