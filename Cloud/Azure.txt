Azure_Services
Access from .NET applications - access to most Azure services is provided through the Azure SDK for .NET. The Azure SDK for .NET 
is provided as a series of NuGet packages and can be used in both .NET Core and .NET Framework applications. The Azure SDK for 
.NET makes incorporating Azure services into your application as easy as installing the correct NuGet package, instantiating a 
client object and calling the appropriate methods. More information on the Azure SDK for .NET can be found in the Azure SDK for 
.NET Overview.

While Azure contains over 100 services, the following Azure services are the services you will use most frequently as a .NET developer.

Service	Descriptions
Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for hosting web applications and APIs in Azure. It features automatic load balancing 
and auto-scaling in a highly available environment. You pay only for the compute resources you use and free tiers are available.

Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that lets you write small, discrete segments of code that can be executed in a 
scalable and cost-effective manner, all without managing any servers or runtimes. Functions can be invoked by a variety of different 
events and easily integrate with other Azure services through the use of input and output bindings.

Azure SQL is a fully managed cloud based version of SQL Server. Azure automatically performs traditional administrative tasks like 
patching and backups for you and features built-in high availability.

Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed NoSQL database with single digit response times, automatic scaling, and a MongoDB compatible API.
*NoSQL databases store data in a format other than relational tables.

Azure Blob Storage allows your applications to store and retrieve files in the cloud. Azure Storage is highly scalable to store 
massive amounts of data and data is stored redundantly to ensure high availability.

Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker supporting both point to point and publish-subscribe integrations. 
It is ideal for building decoupled applications, queue based load leveling, or facilitating communication between microservices.

Azure Key Vault	- Every application has application secrets like connection strings and API keys it must store. Azure Key Vault 
helps you store and access those secrets securely, in an encrypted vault with restricted access to make sure your secrets and 
your application are not compromised.

Azure Cognitive Services are a collection of cloud-based services that allow you to add AI based capabilities to your application. 
Examples include computer vision, speech recognition, language understanding, and anomaly detection.

Serverless_Architecture - Azure Functions simplify building solutions to handle event-driven workflows, whether responding to HTTP 
requests, handling file uploads in Blob storage, or processing events in a queue. You write only the code necessary to handle your 
event without worrying about servers or framework code. Further, you can take advantage of over 250 connectors to other Azure and 
third-party services to tackle your toughest integration problems.
