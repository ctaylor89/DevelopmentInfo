The AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals exam covers foundational knowledge of cloud concepts and core Azure services. 
Below are the key topics divided into domains, along with the percentage of questions likely to come from each area:

1. Cloud Concepts (25-30%)
Benefits of cloud computing: 
High availability, scalability, elasticity, agility, disaster recovery, and cost considerations.
Cloud service models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).
Cloud deployment models: Public, private, and hybrid cloud.
Principles of economies of scale: Cost savings from shared resources.

2. Azure Core Services (15-20%)  What is it and what is the purpose(or advantage) of each
Core Azure architectural components:
Azure Regions, Region Pairs, Availability Zones, Resource Groups, Subscriptions, and Management Groups.

Core Azure services and products:
Compute (e.g., Virtual Machines, Azure Kubernetes Service).
Networking (e.g., Virtual Networks, VPN Gateway, Azure CDN).
Storage (e.g., Blob Storage, Disk Storage, File Storage).
Databases (e.g., Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB).

Core Azure solutions: Internet of Things (IoT), AI and machine learning, serverless computing, and DevOps.

3. Security, Privacy, Compliance, and Trust (25-30%)
Azure Security: Azure Security Center, Azure Sentinel, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and identity management, 
                Network security groups (NSGs), Azure Firewall, Azure DDoS Protection.
                .
Azure identity and governance: Azure Active Directory (AAD), Conditional Access and MFA, Azure Policy, Blueprints, 
                               Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), resource tagging and Locks.
                               Monitoring tools like Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insight

Trust and compliance:
Microsoft Privacy Statement, Trust Center, and Service Trust Portal.
Azure compliance certifications.

4. Azure Pricing and Support (20-25%)
Cost management:
Azure subscriptions, pricing, and factors affecting costs (e.g., region, type of service).
Azure Cost Management and TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) Calculator.

Service level agreements (SLAs):
SLA metrics for Azure services (uptime, performance).
Composite SLAs.

Azure support plans:
Basic, Developer, Standard, Professional Direct, and Premier.
Azure Service Health and the knowledge base.
