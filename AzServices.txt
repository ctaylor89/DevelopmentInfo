A Fault Domain is a group of resources that share the same power, network, and hardware rack. The impact of a hardware 
failure is minimized for VM's when an Availability set distributes the VM instances across separate fault domains.

An update domain ensures grouped VMs are updated in stages, preventing all VM groups from going down during maintenance.

Blueprints help organizations define, deploy, and manage cloud environments in a repeatable and consistent manner.

Resource Manager templates define the infrastructure and configuration of resources in a repeatable way.

Route-Based Gateway refers to an Virtual Network Gateway configured to support route-based VPN connections.

A Route-Based VPN is a specific type of VPN configuration that uses a routing table.
A Policy-based VPN uses static routing rules to define what traffic should pass through the VPN tunnel.

Virtual Network (VNet) provides networking capabilities for secure, isolated communication between Azure resources, 
on-premises networks, and the internet.

Virtual Network Peering connects Azure VNets for seamless, private global communication without using gateways.

VPN uses an encrypted tunnel within another network. VPNs are typically deployed to connect two or 
more trusted private networks to one another over an untrusted network (typically the public internet).
