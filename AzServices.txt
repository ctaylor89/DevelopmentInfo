What are the access tiers for blob storage?
Azure Blob Storage offers the following access tiers to optimize cost and performance based on data usage:

Hot Tier: It has higher storage costs but lower access costs. Designed for frequently accessed or modified data. 

Cool Tier: It has lower storage costs but higher access costs (compared to the hot tier).
Designed for infrequently accessed data that needs to be stored for at least 30 days. 

Cold Tier: It offers lower storage costs but higher access costs. (compared to the cool tier )
Designed for rarely accessed data that requires fast retrieval.  Data must be stored for at least 90 days. 

Archive Tier: It offers the lowest storage costs but the highest access costs. Best for data that is rarely accessed and 
can tolerate a long retrieval latency of hours. Data must be stored for at least 180 days. 

Premium block blobs are optimized for scenarios that require low latency and high throughput, such as media streaming or 
transaction-heavy workloads. Unlike the Hot, Cool, Cold, and Archive tiers, Premium block blobs are designed specifically for 
performance-sensitive applications.

* High throughput refers to the ability to transfer large amounts of data quickly and efficiently over a period of time. It's 
about how much data can be read from or written to the storage per second — typically measured in megabytes per second (MB/s) 
or input/output operations per second (IOPS).
