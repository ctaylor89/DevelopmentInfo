Points_to_Remember

When using Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS) in Azure, data is first copied synchronously three times within a single physical location 
in the primary region (this is known as Locally Redundant Storage (LRS) within that region). Then, asynchronously, the data is 
replicated to the secondary region, where it is also stored three times within a single physical location in that secondary region.
