Networking (e.g., Virtual Networks, VPN Gateway, Azure CDN).
Describe virtual networking, including the purpose of Azure Virtual Networks, Azure virtual subnets, peering, Azure DNS, VPN Gateway, and ExpressRoute.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Azure ExpressRoute lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection, with the help of 
a connectivity provider. ExpressRoute connections don't go over the public Internet.

VPN Gateway

Azure VPN Gateway is a type of virtual network gateway and it enables hybrid cloud and multi-cloud connectivity.
Route-based VPN gateways use routing tables to support route-based VPN connections. 
Policy-based VPN gateways use IPsec selectors to filter traffic.

A Route-Based Gateway refers to an Azure Virtual Network Gateway configured to support route-based VPN connections. 
A Route-Based Gateway uses a routing table.

VPN

A Route-Based VPN is a specific type of VPN configuration that uses a routing table.
A Policy-based VPN uses static routing rules wich are (IPsec policies) to define what traffic should pass through the VPN tunnel.

A VPN uses an encrypted tunnel within another network. VPNs are typically deployed to connect two or 
more trusted private networks to one another over an untrusted network (typically the public internet).
