*** Defend resources running on other clouds ***
Defender for Cloud can also protect resources in other clouds (such as AWS and GCP).
For example, if you've connected an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to an Azure subscription, you can enable any of these protections:
1) Defender for Cloud's CSPM features extend to your AWS resources. This agentless plan assesses your AWS resources according to 
   AWS-specific security recommendations, and includes the results in the secure score. The resources will also be assessed for 
   compliance with built-in standards specific to AWS (AWS CIS, AWS PCI DSS, and AWS Foundational Security Best Practices). Defender 
   for Cloud's asset inventory page is a multicloud enabled feature helping you manage your AWS resources alongside your Azure resources.

2) Microsoft Defender for Containers extends its container threat detection and advanced defenses to your Amazon EKS Linux clusters.
3) Microsoft Defender for Servers brings threat detection and advanced defenses to your Windows and Linux EC2 instances.

Our department currently uses an Azure pipeline to deliver files to an Azure service. We would like to have our Azure pipeline 
deliver files to an AWS server. What are the steps to follow have our Azure pipeline deliver files to an AWS production server 
instead of the Azure server we are currently using?

Memory updated
To transition your Azure pipeline to deliver files to an AWS production server, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the AWS Environment
Set Up AWS Server: Ensure the AWS production server is configured to receive files (e.g., S3 bucket, EC2 instance, or other services).
Create Access Credentials: Generate AWS access keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) for a user with appropriate permissions to upload files.
2. Install AWS Tools in Azure DevOps
Go to your Azure DevOps organization and navigate to your project.
Install the AWS Toolkit for Azure DevOps from the Visual Studio Marketplace.
This toolkit provides tasks to interact with AWS services directly from your Azure pipelines.
3. Configure AWS Service Connection
In Azure DevOps:
Go to Project Settings > Service Connections > New Service Connection.
Choose AWS and provide your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and AWS region.
Save the service connection for use in your pipeline.
4. Modify the Azure Pipeline
Edit your pipeline YAML file or Classic UI pipeline configuration to include tasks for uploading files to AWS.

Example for an S3 Bucket using yaml:

trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- task: UsePythonVersion@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '3.x'

- script: |
    echo "Building files..."
    # Your build steps here
  displayName: 'Build Files'

- task: AmazonWebServices.aws-cli@1
  inputs:
    awsCredentials: '<YourAWSServiceConnection>'
    regionName: 'us-east-1'
    command: 's3'
    arguments: 'cp ./output-file.txt s3://your-s3-bucket-name/path-to-folder/'
---
Example for an EC2 Instance:
You can use SSH or other tools like SCP:

yaml
- task: UsePythonVersion@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '3.x'

- task: SSH@0
  inputs:
    sshEndpoint: '<YourAWSInstanceServiceConnection>'
    runOptions: 'inline'
    inline: |
      echo "Copying files to EC2..."
      scp output-file.txt user@your-ec2-instance:/path/to/destination

5. Test the Pipeline
Run the pipeline and ensure the files are correctly delivered to the AWS server.
Check logs for errors and validate delivery on the AWS side.
6. Update Notifications and Documentation
Notify your team of the changes.
Update documentation to reflect the new AWS configuration and delivery workflow.
By following these steps, you can smoothly transition your Azure pipeline to deliver files to an AWS production server.
