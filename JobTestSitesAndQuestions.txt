Interview_Notes

I’ll answer this **as the testing manager sitting across the table from you**, and I’ll be blunt about what *actually* sounds credible vs. what raises red flags.

## What I Want to Hear (and Why It Works)

A **good, acceptable reason** is not “I’m burned out on coding” or “testing seems easier.”
Those kill your chances instantly.

What *does* work is framing the move as a **shift in where you add the most value**, not a step down.

Here’s the core message I’m listening for:

> “I’m strongest at finding risk, edge cases, and failure paths — and I want a role where that mindset is the primary responsibility.”

That tells me:

* You understand what testing really is
* You’re not running away from development
* You’re moving *toward* quality ownership

---

## A Strong, Realistic Answer You Could Say

You don’t need to memorize this, but this is the **shape** of a winning response:

> “After several years in development, I realized that the part of the job I consistently did best — and enjoyed most — was 
validating behavior, thinking through edge cases, and catching issues before they escaped to production.
>
> I was often the person on the team questioning assumptions, reviewing stories for testability, and writing tests that exposed 
gaps in requirements or logic.
>
> I want to move into software testing because that critical, risk-focused thinking is where I add the most value, and I want 
quality to be my primary responsibility instead of a secondary one.”

Why this works:

* It’s **proactive**, not defensive
* It shows **self-awareness**
* It respects testing as a discipline
* It doesn’t trash development

---

## Even Better: Tie It to Business Impact

If you want bonus points, connect it to outcomes:

> “I’ve seen how small gaps in testing turn into expensive production issues. I want to be in a role where my focus is preventing 
those failures earlier — through better test design, automation, and collaboration with developers.”

That tells me:

* You think beyond code
* You understand cost of defects
* You care about the product, not just tasks

---

## What NOT to Say (Ever)

If I hear any of these, I’m immediately skeptical:

* ❌ “Testing has less pressure”
* ❌ “I’m tired of writing code”
* ❌ “Testing seems more stable”
* ❌ “I want a slower pace”
* ❌ “I already do testing anyway”

Those say:

* You don’t respect the role
* You think testing is a fallback
* You don’t understand modern testing

---

## Why Your Dev Background Is Actually a Selling Point

As a testing manager, I **like** former developers *if* they get this right.

What I assume about you (in a good way):

* You understand how bugs are introduced
* You can read code when black-box testing isn’t enough
* You can write better automation
* You can challenge devs without hand-waving

But I also want to hear that you’re willing to:

* Think like a user
* Test things that “shouldn’t happen”
* Say “this isn’t shippable” when it’s unpopular

---

## One-Sentence Version (If I Push You)

If I ask, *“Bottom line, why testing?”* — this is gold:

> “Because my strength is in preventing defects, not just fixing them — and testing is where 
that mindset has the most impact.”

---

## Final Manager Reality Check

Switching from development to testing is **not** a downgrade if you frame it correctly.
It *is* a red flag if it sounds like an escape hatch.

If you want, I can:

* Help you tailor this answer to **manual vs automation vs SDET**
* Role-play a follow-up interview question I *will* ask next
* Help rewrite your resume so this transition looks intentional, not reactive

Say how deep you want to go.

BASIC SKILLS
Creating and editing software test procedures. Configuring systems for testing software programs. Running software integration and Unit testing. Project architecting, requirements gathering, customer support, training and creating research documentation. 

TESTING EXPERIENCE:
Set up a test computer lab to support testing of software applications and remote controls. Hired and managed one individual to assist in the testing process. Configured test computers and test VM's with operating systems and software versions to match customer environments. 

Created a device simulator using C++ for testing an application during development.
Created unit tests to perform testing while developing a web application for the Navy's HR and utilities management departments. Tested software applications and device drivers for laser marking machines, electronic signature pads and remote controls. 

Created software in C++ to test laser power output levels and automatically adjust the power input as needed.
Tested application features using different user roles to ensure to ensure that only the correct features were available for that role. 

In my last position I Identified errors and areas for improvement in the test procedures. Provided feedback to the team lead. Followed Agile\Scrum methodologies and participated in daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.

#Notes
SOME PROJECTS I HAVE WORKED ON OVER THE YEARS

Worked on a project for the Navy to manage their utilities for their ships and bases. We used C#, JavaScript, AngularJS(V1.5) and an Oracle database.

Worked with a team of developers building a new web application for recruiting new sailors. The web application provides job information and a survey for potential applicants to help determine which jobs in the Navy they would be a good fit for. The website is built using C#, ASP.NET, JQuery, JavaScript. Used ChatGPT and Copilot for AI assistance.   
	
Supported an existing human resource management website by adding some new features to the front and back end code. Used Visual Studio, SQL Server and GIT for development. Researched\documented new technologies such as Azure, Docker and Kubernetes for management to use in their architecture planning meetings. Performed application testing and created new test procedures.

Added a new section to an MVC Web application for the Ventura County Health Services Department to manage their medical providers and community partners.

Added a new feature to an ASP.Net Web Forms website for the sending of messages between Sales Associates and their customers. Also architected a backend solution that consolidates existing messaging and email services using WCF web service for easier maintainability.

Created a web site to report on the performance of medical device batteries using C#, MVC and WCF.
This included a backend service on the client's system that would collect the battery data from the battery charger and then send that data to a RESTful API that I also designed.

Architect and developed a client side service in C# that facilitates the downloading and programming of an emergency vehicle monitoring device. I was also the sole architect and developer of a desktop application that would read and process vehicle driving data from a box located in a non-emergency vehicle.
