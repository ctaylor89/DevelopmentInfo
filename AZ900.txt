Cloud_Service_Types

Some common scenarios where IaaS might make sense include:
	Lift-and-shift migration: You’re setting up cloud resources similar to your on-prem datacenter, and then simply moving the 
	things running on-prem to running on the IaaS infrastructure.

	Testing and development: You have established configurations for development and test environments that you need to rapidly 
	replicate. You can start up or shut down the different environments rapidly with an IaaS structure, while maintaining complete control.

Platform as a service (PaaS) is a middle ground between renting space in a datacenter (infrastructure as a service) and paying for 
a complete and deployed solution (software as a service). In a PaaS environment, the cloud provider maintains the physical 
infrastructure, physical security, and connection to the internet. They also maintain the operating systems, middleware, 
development tools, and business intelligence services that make up a cloud solution. In a PaaS scenario, you don't have to worry about 
the licensing or patching for operating systems and databases.

Some common scenarios where PaaS might make sense include:

Development framework: PaaS provides a framework that developers can build upon to develop or customize cloud-based applications. 
Similar to the way you create an Excel macro, PaaS lets developers create applications using built-in software components. 

Analytics or business intelligence: Tools provided as a service with PaaS allow organizations to analyze and mine their data, 
finding insights and patterns and predicting outcomes to improve forecasting, product design decisions, investment returns, and 
other business decisions.

Software as a service (SaaS) is the most complete cloud service model from a product perspective. With SaaS, you’re essentially 
renting or using a fully developed application.

Private cloud
It’s a cloud (delivering IT services over the internet) that’s used by a single entity. A private cloud may be hosted from your 
on site datacenter. It may also be hosted in a dedicated datacenter offsite, potentially even by a third party that has dedicated 
that datacenter to your company.

Public cloud
A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. With a public cloud, anyone that wants to 
purchase cloud services can access and use resources. 
---
Hybrid cloud - Definition 1 (Combines public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment)
A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment. A hybrid 
cloud environment can be used to allow a private cloud to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying public cloud 
resources. Hybrid cloud can be used to provide an extra layer of security. For example, users can flexibly choose which services 
to keep in public cloud and which to deploy to their private cloud infrastructure.

Hybrid cloud - Definition 2 (Combines on-premises data centers (private cloud) with public cloud services)
A hybrid cloud model is an infrastructure approach that combines on-premises data centers (private cloud) with public cloud services, 
such as Microsoft Azure, to create a unified, flexible, and scalable computing environment. It enables organizations to run workloads 
and manage resources seamlessly across both environments while benefiting from the strengths of each.
---
Multi-cloud
A multi-cloud model refers to an infrastructure strategy where an organization uses services from multiple cloud providers, such as 
Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and others. This approach enables businesses to distribute 
workloads, optimize performance, enhance reliability, and avoid vendor lock-in by leveraging the strengths of different cloud 
platforms. multi-cloud scenario, you use multiple public cloud providers. Maybe you use different features from different 
cloud providers.

Azure Arc
Azure Arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment. Azure Arc can help manage your cloud environment, 
whether it's a public cloud solely on Azure, a private cloud in your datacenter, a hybrid configuration, or even a multi-cloud 
environment running on multiple cloud providers at once. For hybrid and multicloud environments, Microsoft Defender plans are 
extended to non-Azure machines with the help of Azure Arc. 

Azure VMware Solution (AVS) is a Microsoft service that allows organizations to seamlessly run VMware workloads natively in Azure. 
It provides a fully managed environment that integrates VMware infrastructure with Azure services, enabling businesses to extend 
or migrate their on-premises VMware environments to the cloud without refactoring applications or changing operational processes. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Governance_And_Compliance

Microsoft Purview is a comprehensive, unified data governance solution that helps organizations discover, manage, protect, and 
govern their data assets across on-premises, multi-cloud, and SaaS environments. It provides tools for compliance, risk management, 
and data security to help organizations meet regulatory requirements, protect sensitive information, and enable better data-driven 
decision-making. Microsoft Purview extends to external sources, providing a centralized governance layer.

* Lineage tracking refers to the process of understanding, visualizing, and documenting the journey of data as it flows through 
systems, applications, and processes. It provides a detailed view of where data originates, how it transforms, and where it ends up.
---
Azure Policy is a service in Azure that enables you to create, assign, and manage policies that control or audit your resources. 
These policies enforce different rules across your resource configurations so that those configurations stay compliant with 
corporate standards.

Azure Policy enables you to define both individual policies and groups of related policies, known as initiatives. Azure Policy 
evaluates your resources and highlights resources that are not compliant with the policies you've created. Azure Policy can also 
prevent noncompliant resources from being created.

Azure Policies can be set at each level, enabling you to set policies on a specific resource, resource group, subscription, and 
so on. Additionally, Azure Policies are inherited by the lower levels.

Azure Policy comes with built-in policy and initiative definitions for Storage, Networking, Compute, Security Center, and Monitoring. 
For example, if you define a policy that allows only a certain size for the virtual machines (VMs) to be used in your environment, 
that policy is invoked when you create a new VM and whenever you resize existing VMs. Azure Policy also evaluates and monitors all 
current VMs in your environment, including VMs that were created before the policy was created.

In some cases, Azure Policy can automatically remediate noncompliant resources and configurations to ensure the integrity of the 
state of the resources. For example, if all resources in a certain resource group should be tagged with AppName tag and a value of 
"SpecialOrders," Azure Policy will automatically apply that tag if it is missing. If you have a specific resource that you don’t 
want Azure Policy to automatically fix, you can flag that resource as an exception 

Azure Policy also integrates with Azure DevOps by applying any continuous integration and delivery pipeline policies that pertain 
to the pre-deployment and post-deployment phases of your applications. An Azure Policy initiative is a way of grouping related 
policies together. The initiative definition contains all of the policy definitions to help track your compliance state.
---
Resource locks prevent resources from being deleted or updated, depending on the type of lock. Resource locks can be applied to 
individual resources, resource groups, or even an entire subscription. Resource locks are inherited. There are two types of 
resource locks: 
	Delete means authorized users can still read and modify a resource, but they can't delete the resource.
	ReadOnly means authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update the resource. 

You can manage resource locks from the Azure portal, PowerShell, the Azure CLI, or from an Azure Resource Manager template.
Resource locks apply regardless of RBAC permissions. Even if you're an owner of the resource, you must still remove the 
lock before you can perform the blocked activity.

Random_Notes

High availability focuses on ensuring maximum availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur.

Scalability refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demand.

With vertical scaling, if you were developing an app and you needed more processing power, you could vertically scale up to 
add more CPUs or RAM to the virtual machine.

With horizontal scaling, if you suddenly experienced a steep jump in demand, your deployed resources could be scaled out 
(either automatically or manually). For example, you could add additional virtual machines or containers, scaling out.

Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function.

Predictability can be focused on performance predictability or cost predictability.

Performance predictability focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for your customers. 
Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability are just some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability. If 
you suddenly need more resources, autoscaling can deploy additional resources to meet the demand, and then scale back when the 
demand drops. Or if the traffic is heavily focused on one area, load balancing will help redirect some of the overload to less 
stressed areas.

Cost predictability is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend. With the cloud, you can track your 
resource use in real time, monitor resources to ensure that you’re using them in the most efficient way, and apply data analytics 
to find patterns and trends that help better plan resource deployments. By operating in the cloud and using cloud analytics and 
information, you can predict future costs and adjust your resources as needed. You can even use tools like the Total Cost of 
Ownership (TCO) or Pricing Calculator to get an estimate of potential cloud spend.

Whether you’re deploying infrastructure as a service or software as a service, cloud features support governance and compliance. 
Things like set templates help ensure that all your deployed resources meet corporate standards and government regulatory 
requirements. Plus, you can update all your deployed resources to new standards as standards change. Cloud-based auditing helps 
flag any resource that’s out of compliance with your corporate standards and provides mitigation strategies. Depending on your 
operating model, software patches and updates may also automatically be applied, which helps with both governance and security.

Management of the cloud speaks to managing your cloud resources. In the cloud, you can:
	Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
	Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
	Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
	Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics, so you’re aware of performance in real time.

Management in the cloud speaks to how you’re able to manage your cloud environment and resources. 
You can manage your cloud environment and resources:
	Through a web portal.
	Using a command line interface.
	Using APIs.
	Using PowerShell.

The Microsoft Service Trust Portal (STP) is a valuable resource for Azure administrators, especially those responsible for security, 
compliance, and governance. The Service Trust Portal provides access to tools, documentation, and information to help organizations 
manage compliance and trust requirements in Azure and other Microsoft services.
