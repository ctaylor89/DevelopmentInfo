Here’s a rewritten, cleaned-up prompt template that explicitly defines the domain model properties and removes ambiguity. 
This is how you want to specify it if you expect consistent API output.
-------------------------------------------------------------
	Act as a senior .NET 8 C# developer and REST API designer.

	Goal:
	Design a RESTful Web API for managing Pods using a domain-driven approach.
	Sketch the ASP.NET Core controller

	Domain Model (REQUIRED — DO NOT MODIFY):
	The domain model is named "Pod" and contains the following properties:

	- Id (int) — unique identifier for the Pod
	- Name (string) — human-readable name of the Pod
	- Size (int) — numeric size value of the Pod
	- Temperature (double) — temperature associated with the Pod

	Context:
	Design the API around the Pod domain model and its key business rules.

	Constraints:
	- Use JSON for all request and response bodies
	- Follow RESTful conventions
	- Assume ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 8)
	- Use clear and consistent naming

	Required Output:
	1. Define the endpoint paths and corresponding HTTP verbs for Pod management
	2. Define request and response schemas for each endpoint
	3. Provide example JSON payloads for requests and responses
	4. Define validation rules and possible error responses (including HTTP status codes)
	5. Define the DTO model using c# that has the same properties as domain model 
	6. Sketch the .NET 8 controller based on the DTO model (without implementation)

	Do not generate implementation code.
	Do not invent additional domain properties.
	Do not add unrelated endpoints.

Below is a reusable prompt macro you can drop into any API-design workflow. It’s parameterized, rigid, and designed to 
be reused by swapping values—not rewriting the prompt every time.

Notes: Why this works:
You change values, not structure
The model can’t “helpfully” add fields
Works for any CRUD-style domain
Easy to embed into automation or agents
If you want next steps, I can:
Add business-rule macros

-----------------------------------------------------------
Add pagination / filtering macros
Convert this into a multi-phase generator macro
Adapt it for Minimal APIs instead of controllers

My goal: Ask the AI machine to give me instructions to add authentication to an existing Web API Application.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Act as a senior .NET 8 C# developer and REST API designer.
Goal: Provide step-by-step instructions to add authentication to an existing ASP.NET Core Web API application
that is not currently using any authentication mechanism.

1. Choose an authentication method:
   - Decide between JWT Bearer tokens, cookie-based authentication, or another method based on your application's needs.

2. Install necessary NuGet packages:
   - For JWT Bearer authentication, install the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` package.
   - For cookie-based authentication, install the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies` package.

3. Configure authentication services:
   - In `Program.cs`, add the authentication services to the DI container:
     ```csharp
     builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =>
     {
         options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
         options.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
     })
     .AddJwtBearer(options =>
     {
         options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
         {
             ValidateIssuer = true,
             ValidateAudience = true,
             ValidateLifetime = true,
             ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
             // Set your issuer, audience, and signing key here
         };
     });
     ```

4. Protect your API endpoints:
   - Use the `[Authorize]` attribute on controllers or actions that require authentication.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     [Authorize]
     [ApiController]
     [Route("api/[controller]")]
     public class PodController : ControllerBase
     {
         // Your actions here
     }
     ```

5. Implement user login and token generation:
   - Create a login endpoint that validates user credentials and generates a JWT token.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     [HttpPost("login")]
     public IActionResult Login([FromBody] LoginRequest request)
     {
         // Validate user credentials
         // Generate JWT token
         return Ok(new { Token = jwtToken });
     }
     ```

6. Test your authentication:
   - Use a tool like Postman to test your API endpoints.
   - Include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header for protected endpoints.

7. (Optional) Implement user registration:
   - Create a registration endpoint to allow new users to sign up.
   - Hash passwords and store user information securely.

8. (Optional) Configure authorization policies:
   - Define custom authorization policies if needed.
   - Use the `[Authorize(Policy = "YourPolicyName")]` attribute to apply them.

9. (Optional) Add role-based or claims-based authorization:
   - Implement role-based or claims-based authorization as needed for your application.

10. Document your API:
    - Update your API documentation to include authentication details.
    - Provide examples of how to obtain and use JWT tokens or cookies.
