Here’s a rewritten, cleaned-up prompt template that explicitly defines the domain model properties and removes ambiguity. 
This is how you want to specify it if you expect consistent API output.
-------------------------------------------------------------
	Act as a senior .NET 8 C# developer and REST API designer.

	Goal:
	Design a RESTful Web API for managing Pods using a domain-driven approach.
	Sketch the ASP.NET Core controller

	Domain Model (REQUIRED — DO NOT MODIFY):
	The domain model is named "Pod" and contains the following properties:

	- Id (int) — unique identifier for the Pod
	- Name (string) — human-readable name of the Pod
	- Size (int) — numeric size value of the Pod
	- Temperature (double) — temperature associated with the Pod

	Context:
	Design the API around the Pod domain model and its key business rules.

	Constraints:
	- Use JSON for all request and response bodies
	- Follow RESTful conventions
	- Assume ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 8)
	- Use clear and consistent naming

	Required Output:
	1. Define the endpoint paths and corresponding HTTP verbs for Pod management
	2. Define request and response schemas for each endpoint
	3. Provide example JSON payloads for requests and responses
	4. Define validation rules and possible error responses (including HTTP status codes)
	5. Define the DTO model using c# that has the same properties as domain model 
	6. Sketch the .NET 8 controller based on the DTO model (without implementation)

	Do not generate implementation code.
	Do not invent additional domain properties.
	Do not add unrelated endpoints.
-----------------------------------------------------------
 *This was used to generate the code files for AI_Built_WebAPI.
Below is a reusable prompt macro you can drop into any API-design workflow. It’s parameterized, rigid, and designed to 
be reused by swapping values—not rewriting the prompt every time.

Notes: Why this works:
You change values, not structure
The model can’t “helpfully” add fields
Works for any CRUD-style domain
Easy to embed into automation or agents
If you want next steps, I can:
Add business-rule macros

-----------------------------------------------------------
Add pagination / filtering macros
Convert this into a multi-phase generator macro
Adapt it for Minimal APIs instead of controllers
