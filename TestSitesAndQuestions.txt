Interview_Notes

I’ll answer this **as the testing manager sitting across the table from you**, and I’ll be blunt about what *actually* sounds credible vs. what raises red flags.

---

## What I Want to Hear (and Why It Works)

A **good, acceptable reason** is not “I’m burned out on coding” or “testing seems easier.”
Those kill your chances instantly.

What *does* work is framing the move as a **shift in where you add the most value**, not a step down.

Here’s the core message I’m listening for:

> “I’m strongest at finding risk, edge cases, and failure paths — and I want a role where that mindset is the primary responsibility.”

That tells me:

* You understand what testing really is
* You’re not running away from development
* You’re moving *toward* quality ownership

---

## A Strong, Realistic Answer You Could Say

You don’t need to memorize this, but this is the **shape** of a winning response:

> “After several years in development, I realized that the part of the job I consistently did best — and enjoyed most — was validating behavior, thinking through edge cases, and catching issues before they escaped to production.
>
> I was often the person on the team questioning assumptions, reviewing stories for testability, and writing tests that exposed gaps in requirements or logic.
>
> I want to move into software testing because that critical, risk-focused thinking is where I add the most value, and I want quality to be my primary responsibility instead of a secondary one.”

Why this works:

* It’s **proactive**, not defensive
* It shows **self-awareness**
* It respects testing as a discipline
* It doesn’t trash development

---

## Even Better: Tie It to Business Impact

If you want bonus points, connect it to outcomes:

> “I’ve seen how small gaps in testing turn into expensive production issues. I want to be in a role where my focus is preventing those failures earlier — through better test design, automation, and collaboration with developers.”

That tells me:

* You think beyond code
* You understand cost of defects
* You care about the product, not just tasks

---

## What NOT to Say (Ever)

If I hear any of these, I’m immediately skeptical:

* ❌ “Testing has less pressure”
* ❌ “I’m tired of writing code”
* ❌ “Testing seems more stable”
* ❌ “I want a slower pace”
* ❌ “I already do testing anyway”

Those say:

* You don’t respect the role
* You think testing is a fallback
* You don’t understand modern testing

---

## Why Your Dev Background Is Actually a Selling Point

As a testing manager, I **like** former developers *if* they get this right.

What I assume about you (in a good way):

* You understand how bugs are introduced
* You can read code when black-box testing isn’t enough
* You can write better automation
* You can challenge devs without hand-waving

But I also want to hear that you’re willing to:

* Think like a user
* Test things that “shouldn’t happen”
* Say “this isn’t shippable” when it’s unpopular

---

## One-Sentence Version (If I Push You)

If I ask, *“Bottom line, why testing?”* — this is gold:

> “Because my strength is in preventing defects, not just fixing them — and testing is where that mindset has the most impact.”

---

## Final Manager Reality Check

Switching from development to testing is **not** a downgrade if you frame it correctly.
It *is* a red flag if it sounds like an escape hatch.

If you want, I can:

* Help you tailor this answer to **manual vs automation vs SDET**
* Role-play a follow-up interview question I *will* ask next
* Help rewrite your resume so this transition looks intentional, not reactive

Say how deep you want to go.
